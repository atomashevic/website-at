  abstract = {At any given time, the stability of a community depends on the right balance of trust and distrust. Furthermore, we face information overload, increased uncertainty and risk taking as a prominent feature of modern living. As members of society, we cope with these complexities and uncertainties by relying trust, which is the basis of all social interactions. Although a small number of trust models have been proposed for the virtual medium, we find that they are largely impractical and artificial. In this paper we provide and discuss a trust model that is grounded in real-world social trust characteristics, and based on a reputation mechanism, or word-of-mouth. Our proposed model allows agents to decide which other agents' opinions they trust more and allows agents to progressively tune their understanding of another agent's subjective recommendations.},

Existing methods for trust management, that are based on reputation, focus on the semantic properties of the trust model. They do not scale as they either rely on a central database or require to maintain global knowledge at each agent to provide data on earlier interactions. In this paper we present an approach that addresses the problem of reputation-based trust management at both the data management and the semantic level. We employ at both levels scalable data structures and algorithms that require no central control and allow to assess trust by computing an agents reputation from its former interactions with other agents. Thus the meethod can be implemented in a peer-to-peer environment and scales well for very large numbers of participants. We expect that scalable methods for trust management are an important factor, if fully decentralized peer-to-peer systems should become the platform for more serious applications than simple file exchange.},

While a growing literature investigates the role of election results as signals for parties' policy adaption, it has mostly focused on vote changes of individual parties. However, parties do not know only whether they have won or lost in an election; they also have detailed information on which parties they won votes from and which parties they lost votes to. We make two arguments about how voter transitions should affect the strategic policy choices of political parties. First, when a party has lost votes to another party it will adapt its policy positions toward that party. Second, parties that have overall lost more votes become more likely to adapt their positions. Making use of a data set on individual voter transitions and party positions we can demonstrate that voter transitions indeed affect parties' competitive behavior.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces a new data-driven methodology for estimating sparse covariance matrices of the random coefficients in logit mixture models. Researchers typically specify covariance matrices in logit mixture models under one of two extreme assumptions: either an unrestricted full covariance matrix (allowing correlations between all random coefficients), or a restricted diagonal matrix (allowing no correlations at all). Our objective is to find optimal subsets of correlated coefficients for which we estimate covariances. We propose a new estimator, called MISC, that uses a mixed-integer optimization (MIO) program to find an optimal block diagonal structure specification for the covariance matrix, corresponding to subsets of correlated coefficients, for any desired sparsity level using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) posterior draws from the unrestricted full covariance matrix. The optimal sparsity level of the covariance matrix is determined using out-of-sample validation. We demonstrate the ability of MISC to correctly recover the true covariance structure from synthetic data. In an empirical illustration using a stated preference survey on modes of transportation, we use MISC to obtain a sparse covariance matrix indicating how preferences for attributes are related to one another.},

In this paper, we use Latent Class Analysis to identify participants' behavior regarding political participation and engagement based on the nature of their interaction on social media. The LCA findings reveal three statistically distinct and behavioral classes regarding political interaction on social media. The profiles were ranged from `Activist' that show more engagement in political activity, such as following candidates and political parties, posting and participating in discussions related to economic, social or political issues or, encouraging others to debate their point of view, to `Agitator' and `Outsider' profiles that show a low probability of interacting on social media and engaging in political actions. The LCA technique has provided meaningful and distinct information on the participants' political profile than clustering classical techniques.},

It states that in natural systems digits' frequency have a certain pattern such that the occurrence of first digits in numbers are unevenly distributed. In systems with natural behavior, numbers begin with a "1" are more common than numbers beginning with "9". It implies that if the distribution of first digits deviate from the expected distribution, it is indicative of fraud. It has many applications in forensic accounting, stock markets, finding abnormal data in survey data, and natural science. We investigate whether social media bots and Information Operations activities are conformant to the Benford's law. Our results showed that bots' behavior adhere to Benford's law, suggesting that using this law helps in detecting malicious online automated accounts and their activities on social media. However, activities related to Information Operations did not show consistency in regards to Benford's law. Our findings shed light on the importance of examining regular and anomalous online behavior to avoid malicious and contaminated content on social media.},

First, we assess the terms that scholars typically use when examining attitudes and highlight the areas of public opinion research that have received the most attention. Second, we focus on the data and measurement challenges related to examining attitudes in the United States and across many nations. Third, we consider how and why attitudes and related laws have changed over time and across nations. Finally, we discuss the major micro and macro empirical forces that influence and the theoretical explanations for why there are such differences in attitudes.

We find that African Americans initially appear less tolerant than other racial groups, until we account for the geographical distribution of attitudes across the nation. Additionally, once we consider religious involvement, strength of belief, and religious affiliation African Americans appear to have warmer feelings about homosexuality than whites. Drawing on the moral communities' hypothesis, we also find that the strength of religiosity amongst county residents heightens the influence of personal religious beliefs on disapproving attitudes. There is also a direct effect of the proportion conservative Protestant, whereby people of all faiths have cooler attitudes towards homosexual individuals when they reside in a county with a higher proportion of conservative Protestants. Finally, we do not find any evidence for an African American cultural influence on attitudes.},

In a study on a representative sample of Dutch Defence personnel (N = 1,607) we tested this model. Structural equation modeling of several items measuring the attitude toward homosexuality offers a six factor solution. These six factors are more or less comparable to the five dimensions we distinguished.

  abstract = {Over the past decade, social network analysis has earned pivotal eminence in the area of web mining and information retrieval. Community detection, being the indispensable part of social network analysis; has garnered far reaching usance in business analytics, healthcare, security, research and policy making. With the embodiment of copious domains to social networks and unprecedented rise in the data \textemdash{} produced, accessed and stored globally; the task of handling the unpredictable, dynamic and ever evolving topological nature of social networks has become arduous. In this regard, quantum computing (QC) has emerged as the most promising trailblazer guaranteeing unprecedented data storage and manipulation capabilities by- dynamic allocation of cluster size and architecture, quantum parallelism, reduced parameter dependency, etc. QC based algorithms have registered exponential speedup over many classical problems with better efficiency and abated time complexity; apart from solving NP-hard problems that were unrealizable classically. Accordingly, a comprehensive literature survey has been presented for social network analysis and community detection highlighting the limitations prevalent in the current technologies. A brief insight into quantum computing and its proficiency in rendering to larger storage systems has been presented; as a solution to the inherent problems present in the existing community detection approaches. A systematic account of quantum computing based community detection techniques has been summarized and discussed as a more prudent future alternative to social network analysis and community detection. Lastly, complexity analysis and modularity based comparison of QC based algorithms with other state of the art algorithms has been carried out to establish the supremacy of quantum algorithms in community detection.},

The previous model used poll data from either another single similar state or national polls to create prior distributions and used the MLE estimators to fit the model. We present new models with minor differences that are used on the same data used in the previous model. The new models now pool the polls together from other states in the regions and uses the pooled estimates as the prior instead of relying on poll data from one state. The new models compare the beta and Gaussian conjugate prior and use three different methods to reassign undecided voters, and either updates iteratively or pools the polls together and performs the calculation once. We also provide a variety of models to serve as comparison for the model's accuracy such as a noninformative model, and polls only model.},

Second, we assume that the dynamics of the mortality rates can be modelled through a Gaussian Markov random field. We use efficient Bayesian methods to estimate the parameters and the latent states of the models proposed. Both methodologies are tested with past data and are used to forecast mortality rates both for large (UK and Wales) and small (New Zealand) populations up to 21 years ahead. We demonstrate that predictions for individual survivor functions and other posterior summaries of demographic and actuarial interest are readily obtained.

  abstract = {Social networks continuously change as new ties are created and existing ones fade. It is widely acknowledged that our social embedding has a substantial impact on what information we receive and how we form beliefs and make decisions. However, most empirical studies on the role of social networks in collective intelligence have overlooked the dynamic nature of social networks and its role in fostering adaptive collective intelligence. Therefore, little is known about how groups of individuals dynamically modify their local connections and, accordingly, the topology of the network of interactions to respond to changing environmental conditions. In this paper, we address this question through a series of behavioral experiments and supporting simulations. Our results reveal that, in the presence of plasticity and feedback, social networks can adapt to biased and changing information environments and produce collective estimates that are more accurate than their best-performing member. To explain these results, we explore two mechanisms: 1) a global-adaptation mechanism where the structural connectivity of the network itself changes such that it amplifies the estimates of high-performing members within the group (i.e., the network ``edges'' encode the computation); and 2) a local-adaptation mechanism where accurate individuals are more resistant to social influence (i.e., adjustments to the attributes of the ``node'' in the network); therefore, their initial belief is disproportionately weighted in the collective estimate. Our findings substantiate the role of social-network plasticity and feedback as key adaptive mechanisms for refining individual and collective judgments.},

We introduce Empirica: a modular virtual lab that offers a solution to the usability-functionality trade-off by employing a "flexible defaults" design strategy. This strategy enables us to maintain complete "build anything" flexibility while offering a development platform that is accessible to novice programmers. Empirica's architecture is designed to allow for parameterizable experimental designs, re-usable protocols, and rapid development. These features will increase the accessibility of virtual lab experiments, remove barriers to innovation in experiment design, and enable rapid progress in the understanding of distributed human computation.},

  month = jun,
  abstract = {Questions regarding whether, and if so, under what conditions, groups exhibit ''crowd wisdom'' have spurred numerous studies in many disciplines, including management and organizational science, psychology, sociology, complex systems, and computer science. Substantial effort in previous research on these questions has focused on investigating the role of social influence in promoting the wisdom of the crowd or, conversely, leading the crowd astray. Specifically, many previous studies have sought to infer the importance of social influence network attributes (such as influence centralization) to explain the accuracy of collective estimates. In this paper, we argue that this approach is limited and can lead to inconsistent conclusions. Based on our theoretical analysis, numerical simulation, and reanalysis of four previously published experiments (which included a total of 4,002 human participants, organized in 131 independent groups), we demonstrate that the wisdom of crowds in estimation tasks depends on the interaction between the following two factors: (i) centralization of the social influence network, and (ii) the features of the estimation context---i.e., the distribution of the initial (pre-influence) estimates. Specifically, we find that centralized influence is desirable in situations where a crowd is predisposed to overestimation bias and/or have a high likelihood of committing egregious errors. By adopting a framework that integrates both the structure of social influence and the estimation context, we bring the previously conflicting results under one theoretical framework and clarify the effects of influence centralization on the quality of crowd wisdom.},

We study a finite horizon optimal control problem, in which deviations of opinions between agents and with respect to the leader are penalized along with the control that is applied only to the leader. The existence conditions for optimal consensus control are proved and necessary optimality conditions for the considered problem are derived.

We investigate the coevolution of opinion and location by extending the Deffuant\textendash Weisbuch bounded confidence opinion model to include mobility inspired by the psychological theories of homophily and dissonance, where agents are attracted or repelled by their neighbours based on the agreement of their opinions. Based on wide experimentation, we characterize the time it takes to converge to a steady state and the local diversity of opinions that results, finding that homophily leads to drastic differences in the nature of consensus. We further extend our mobility model and add noise in order to check the model's robustness, finding that a number of opinion clusters survive even with high levels of noise.},

Among many models, the distance dynamics model proposed recently is shown to be able to faithfully capture natural communities that are of different sizes. However, the state-of-the-art algorithm AttractorAttractor\textbackslash mathsf \{Attractor\} for distance dynamics does not scale to graphs with large maximum vertex degrees, which is the case for large real graphs. In this paper, we aim to scale distance dynamics to large graphs. To achieve that, we propose a fast distance dynamics algorithm FDDFDD\textbackslash mathsf \{FDD\}. We show that FDDFDD\textbackslash mathsf \{FDD\} has a worst-case time complexity of O(T{$\cdot\gamma\cdot$}m)O(T{$\cdot\gamma\cdot$}m) \textbackslash mathcal\{O\}(T\textbackslash cdot \textbackslash gamma \textbackslash cdot m), where T is the number of iterations until convergence, {$\gamma\gamma\backslash$}gamma is a small constant, and m is the number of edges in the input graph. Thus, the time complexity of FDDFDD\textbackslash mathsf \{FDD\} does not depend on the maximum vertex degree. Moreover, we also propose optimization techniques to alleviate the dependency on T. We conduct extensive empirical studies on large real graphs and demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of FDDFDD\textbackslash mathsf \{FDD\}.},

Although GGMs are well investigated from a theoretical and applied perspective, important extensions are not well known within the biological community. GGMs assume, for instance, multivariate normal distributed data. If this assumption is violated Mixed Graphical Models (MGMs) can be the better choice.

We show that this bias occurs in the context of both typical closed-ended questions and in list experiments. Inattentive respondents are common and are more prevalent among the young and less educated. Those who do not pass the trap questions interact with the survey instrument in distinctive ways: they take less time to respond; are more likely to report nonattitudes; and display lower consistency in their reported choices. Inattentiveness does not occur completely at random and failing to properly account for it may lead to inaccurate estimates of the prevalence of key political attitudes and behaviors, of both sensitive and more prosaic nature.},

Under the assumptions of certain topologies of interactions and assuming cognitive and informational restrictions, an agent-based model is introduced to analyze the evolution of decisions over time. The results of the simulations show how social pressures can determine the relationship between individual and social preferences. Societies whose agents have strong individual preferences have outcomes with fragmentation processes that generates a higher number of groups. A minor importance of the individual preferences, results in a smaller proportion of individuals maximizing their individual utility. As well, the quantity of options available and the initial proportion of each alternative are significant variables to determine the proportion of individuals selecting a particular option. In addition, the study analyses the existence of equilibrium of the dynamical system. To this aim, the notion of metastable equilibria is introduced and linked to the dynamic analysis.{$<$}/p{$><$}/div{$>$}},

Such actions can reduce the number of simultaneous infections and mitigate the disease spreading, which is relevant to the risk of a healthcare system collapse. Although these strategies can be suggested, their actual implementation may depend on the population perception of the disease risk. The current COVID-19 crisis, for instance, is showing that some individuals are much more prone than others to remain isolated, avoiding unnecessary contacts. With this motivation, we propose an epidemiological SIR model that uses evolutionary game theory to take into account dynamic individual quarantine strategies, intending to combine in a single process social strategies, individual risk perception, and viral spreading. The disease spreads in a population whose agents can choose between self-isolation and a lifestyle careless of any epidemic risk. The strategy adoption is individual and depends on the perceived disease risk compared to the quarantine cost. The game payoff governs the strategy adoption, while the epidemic process governs the agent's health state. At the same time, the infection rate depends on the agent's strategy while the perceived disease risk depends on the fraction of infected agents. Results show recurrent infection waves, which were seen in previous epidemic scenarios with quarantine. Notably, the risk perception is found to be fundamental for controlling the magnitude of the infection peak, while the final infection size is mainly dictated by the infection rates. Low awareness leads to a single and strong infection peak, while a greater disease risk leads to shorter, although more frequent, peaks. The proposed model spontaneously captures relevant aspects of a pandemic event, highlighting the fundamental role of social strategies.},

The proposed model develops the cooperation agent-based continuous model in which the cooperation of individuals is based on the similarity of evolved ``tags'' which are relative to evolved tag-difference tolerances. In proposed model, an individual's opinion and the individual's tolerance are specified as variables in the model. During communication with each other and with a leader, the resources of individuals are incremented, if they are tolerable to the opinions of their opponents. An opinion formation in population is established by a cooperative process~\textemdash{} changing individual's opinion, if the individual is tolerable to the opinions of opponents, and by a competitive process~\textemdash{} copying opinions and tolerances of successful individuals who have higher resource. Numerical experiments have proven that the public opinion reached a consensus followed the leader's opinion.},

The potential is designed so that the energy spectrum of the Schr\"odinger equation coincides with the graph spectrum of the normalized Laplacian. Crucial information is retained in the reconstructed potential, which provides a compact representation of the properties of the network structure. The median potential over several random network realizations, which we call ensemble potential, is fitted via a Landau-like function, and its length scale is found to diverge as the critical connection probability is approached from above. The ruggedness of the ensemble potential profile is quantified by using the Higuchi fractal dimension, which displays a maximum at the critical connection probability. This demonstrates that this technique can be successfully employed in the study of random networks, as an alternative indicator of the percolation phase transition. We apply the proposed approach to the investigation of real-world networks describing infrastructures (US power grid). Curiously, although no notion of phase transition can be given for such networks, the fractality of the ensemble potential displays signatures of criticality. We also show that standard techniques (such as the scaling features of the largest connected component) do not detect any signature or remnant of criticality.},

  abstract = {We investigate opinion dynamics in multi-agent networks when there exists a bias toward one of two possible opinions; for example, reflecting a status quo vs a superior alternative. Starting with all agents sharing an initial opinion representing the status quo, the system evolves in steps. In each step, one agent selected uniformly at random adopts with some probability {$\alpha$} the superior opinion, and with probability 1 - {$\alpha$} it follows an underlying update rule to revise its opinion on the basis of those held by its neighbors. We analyze the convergence of the resulting process under two wellknown update rules, namely majority and voter. The framework we propose exhibits a rich structure, with a nonobvious interplay between topology and underlying update rule. For example, for the voter rule we show that the speed of convergence bears no significant dependence on the underlying topology, whereas the picture changes completely under the majority rule, where network density negatively affects convergence. We believe that the model we propose is at the same time simple, rich, and modular, affording mathematical characterization of the interplay between bias, underlying opinion dynamics, and social structure in a unified setting.},

The goal is to recover the latent graph structure of the Gaussian vector with observations of the zero-inflated truncated vector. We propose a two step estimation procedure. The first step consists in estimating each term of the covariance matrix by maximising the corresponding bivariate marginal log-likelihood of the truncated vector. The second one uses the graphical lasso procedure to estimate the precision matrix sparsity, which encodes the graph structure. We then state some theoretical convergence results about the convergence rate of the covariance matrix and precision matrix estimators. These results allow us to establish consistency of our procedure with respect to graph structure recovery. We also present some simulation studies to corroborate the efficiency of our procedure.},

Individuals are heterogeneous with respect to income and can change their network links based on utility considerations. We study the impact of income inequality and income redistribution on status competition and individual welfare. We find that individuals with similar income levels tend to be connected to each other in the social network emerging in the long run. Under these circumstances, the income redistribution does not significantly affect the income share spent on the status good and the relative status of individuals. In a relatively equal society, individuals with below median income levels are better off in terms of welfare, everybody else are worse off.

As a consequence, performance claims of the current state-of-the-art have become significantly overestimated. The problems that we have found are mostly related to data overfitting and sampling issues. We discuss the implications for current research and re-conduct experiments to give a more accurate picture of the current state-of-the art methods.

We expand this modeling approach to incorporate directionality of edges, and consider three levels of analysis: triads, subgroups, and the whole network. For triad-level balance, we operationalize a new measure by utilizing semicycles that satisfy the condition of transitivity. For subgroup-level balance, we propose measures of cohesiveness (intra-group solidarity) and divisiveness (inter-group antagonism) to capture balance within and among subgroups of the network using the most fitting partition of nodes into two groups. For network-level balance, we re-purpose the normalized line index to incorporate directionality, and provide the proportion of edges whose position suits balance. Through extensive computational analysis, we quantify and analyze patterns of social structure in triads, subgroups, and the whole network across a range of social settings from college students and Wikipedia editors to philosophers and Bitcoin traders. We then apply our multilevel framework of analysis to examine balance in temporal and multilayer networks, which demonstrates the generalizability of our approach to evaluating balance, and leads to new observations on balance with respect to time and layer dimensions. Our complementary findings on a variety of social networks highlight the need to evaluate balance at different levels. We propose a comprehensive yet parsimonious approach to address this need.},

Using two sets of nationally representative panel data from 1992 to 1996 and 2008 to 2009, we find evidence that affective polarization causes perceived polarization, and that perceived polarization is not related to future affective polarization. Stratifying the models by level of political information, we find that the strength and statistical significance of the relationships between past and future values of affective and perceived polarization are conditional on political sophistication: more sophisticated individuals exhibit stronger relationships.},

In this paper, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the eigenvalues of differently defined partial correlation matrices so that the correlation structure is a valid one. Equipped with these conditions, we will then emphasize the intricacies of algorithmic generations of correlation structures via partial correlation matrices. Furthermore, we examine the space of valid partial correlation structures and juxtapose it with the space of valid Pearson correlation structures. As these spaces turn out to be equal in volume for every dimension and equivalent with respect to rotation, a simple formula allows the creation of valid partial correlation matrices by the use of current algorithms for the generation and approximation of correlation matrices. Lastly, we derive simple conditions on the partial correlations for frequently assumed sparse structures.},

Survey respondents alternate as agents (politicians) and principals (voters), with rewards contingent on their preferred ``candidate'' winning the election. We measure the extent to which voters place their trust in others and are themselves trustworthy, that is, willing to honor requests that may not benefit them. Results provide robust support for a negative effect of uncivil partisan discourse on trust behavior and null results on trustworthiness.},

In three studies of behavior on putative online forums, supporters of a political cause (e.g., abortion or gun rights) preferentially censored comments that opposed their cause. The tendency to selectively censor cause-incongruent online content was amplified among people whose cause-related beliefs were deeply rooted in or ``fused with'' their identities. Moreover, six additional identity-related measures also amplified the selective censoring effect. Finally, selective censoring emerged even when opposing comments were inoffensive and courteous. We suggest that because online censorship enacted by moderators can skew online content consumed by millions of users, it can systematically disrupt democratic dialogue and subvert social harmony.},

Influential nodes are not pre-defined and need to be identified to better understand and control the network. Trust of the nodes can be an important indicator of their influence and trusted nodes can also affect other nodes. However, analysis of trust and influence relationship in social network communities needs investigation. This study proposes a SNTrust model to find the trust of nodes in a network using a local and global trust and also investigates trust, influence and their relationship in SN communities. Different SN-based influence evaluation approaches named K-core, closeness centrality, eigenvector centrality, and page rank is used to find influential nodes. We have explored the trust and influence of nodes in their communities as well as in the network. Different standard datasets such as Consulting Company dataset, Freeman EIES dataset, Blogcatalogue dataset, and Facebook groups dataset are used for experimentation and Pearson's correlation and level of significance (p-value) are used for results evaluation. We found a positive linear correlation between the local trust of a node and its influence. It is found that the nodes which are trusted in the network are highly trusted in their communities. There is a strong linear relationship between the influence of a node in the network and community. Furthermore, it is also observed that nodes that are close to each other in a community have high trust among them. The results show that the proposed SNTrust model performed better in finding trust, influence and their correlation.},

Using an experimental research design and polling station data on fraud and violence during Ghana's 2012 elections, it shows that observers reduced fraud and violence at the polling stations which they monitored. It is argued that local electoral competition shapes party activists' response to observers. As expected, in single-party dominant areas, parties used their local political networks to relocate fraud to polling stations without an election observer, and, in contrast, party activists relocated violence to stations without observers in competitive areas \textendash{} a response that requires less local organizational capacity. This highlights how local party organization and electoral incentives can shape the manipulative electoral strategies employed by parties in democratic elections.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

These practices have benefits for model developers, users, and stakeholders: improved and efficient model design, analysis, testing, and application; increased model acceptance and reuse; and replicability and reproducibility of the model and the simulation experiments.

Discussions appearing around these tweets reflect valuable information from the communities, their interests, and concerns. The majority of the studies on conversational dynamics on social media use the network between users to track the flow of information and impact. In this study, a different approach is introduced in which discussion threads as the network between tweets are considered as the main components of the analysis. Based on this approach, a novel framework is proposed to provide a high-level overview of a Twitter stream. The metric energy is introduced to quantify user engagement in discussions initiated by each tweet and to study the patterns of user-participation overtime. To mine the content of the tweets, some recently developed text analysis methods are integrated into our model to extract the topic of the tweets, the sentiment of the tweets, the stance of tweets toward a controversial topic, and the coherency between the tweet-reply pairs. Three different data sets from politics, healthcare, and sport are collected to be used as case studies. The proposed framework provides a better understanding of how opinions form around a tweet, how different topics to bond together and make the whole discussions, for which topics discussions are more coherent, and which users are able to initiate a cross cutting and coherent conversation over social media.},

  abstract = {The Heider balance addresses three-body interactions with the assumption that triads are equally important in the dynamics of the network. In many networks, the relations do not have the same strength so, triads are differently weighted. Now, the question is how social networks evolve to reduce the number of unbalanced triangles when they are weighted? Are the results foreseeable based on what we have already learned from the unweighted balance? To find the solution, we consider a fully connected network in which triads are assigned with different random weights. Weights are coming from Gaussian probability distribution with mean \$\textbackslash mu\$ and variance \$\textbackslash sigma\$. We study this system in two regimes : (\textbackslash RN\{1\}) the ratio of \$\textbackslash frac\{\textbackslash mu\}\{\textbackslash sigma\} \textbackslash ge 1 \$ corresponds to weak disorder (small variance) that triads' weight are approximately the same, (\textbackslash RN\{2\}) \$\textbackslash frac\{\textbackslash mu\}\{\textbackslash sigma\} {$<$} 1 \$ counts for strong disorder (big variance) and weights are remarkably diverse. Investigating the structural evolution of such a network is our intention. We see disorder plays a key role in determining the critical temperature of the system. Using the mean-field method to present an analytic solution for the system represents that the system undergoes a first-order phase transition. For weak disorder, our simulation results display the system reaches the global minimum as temperature decreases whereas for high disorder we manage to see a seudo-Kondo effect in triadic interactions. The Kondo effect explains the anomalous increase in electrical resistivity of metals due to magnetic impurities at low temperatures. Similar behavior is seen in the energy versus temperature in our work for the second regime and the system does not reach a global minimum.},

Treating these cases as failure events within survival analyses will underestimate the duration of some events. This will bias coefficient estimates, especially in situations where such misclassification is associated with covariates of interest. Our split population survival estimator addresses this challenge by using a system of two equations to explicitly model the misclassification of failure events alongside a parametric survival process of interest. After deriving this model, we use Bayesian estimation via slice sampling to evaluate its performance with simulated data, and in several political science applications. We find that our proposed ``misclassified failure'' survival model allows researchers to accurately account for misclassified failure events within the contexts of civil war duration and democratic survival.},

Here, a common and important problem is to obtain estimates for a second target geography that overlaps with the primary geography but has not been collected from the respondents. We examine this problem when areal level census information is available for both geographic classifications. Such a situation is challenging from a small area estimation perspective for several reasons: there is a misalignment between the census and survey information as well as the geographical classifications; the geographic areas are potentially small and so prediction can be difficult because of the sparse or spatially missing data issue; and there is the possibility of non-stationary spatial dependence. To address these problems we develop a Bayesian model using latent processes, underpinned by a non-stationary spatial basis that combines Moran's I and multiresolution basis functions with a small but representative set of knots. The study results based on simulated data demonstrate that the model can be highly effective and gives more accurate estimates for areas defined by the target geography than several existing models. The model also performs well for the Australian National University poll data to predict on a second geographic classification: statistical area level 2.},

Yet the inherent complexity of such theories makes them difficult to test. These theories often describe multiple sub-processes that interact reciprocally over time, at different levels of analysis, and over different time scales. Computational (i.e., mathematical) modeling is increasingly advocated as a method for developing and testing theories of this type. In organizational sciences however, efforts that have been made to test models empirically are often indirect. We argue that the full potential of computational modeling as a tool for testing dynamic, multilevel theory is yet to be realized. In this paper, we demonstrate an approach to testing dynamic, multilevel theory using computational modeling. The approach uses simulations to generate model predictions, and Bayesian parameter estimation to fit models to empirical data and to facilitate model comparisons. This approach enables a direct integration between theory, model, and data, that we believe enables a more rigorous test of theory.},

Interdependence between a large number of variables is succinctly described by a graphical model, where variables are represented by nodes on a graph and an edge between two nodes is used to indicate their conditional dependence given other variables. Many procedures for making inferences in the high-dimensional setting, typically using penalty functions to induce sparsity in the solution obtained by minimizing a loss function, were developed. Bayesian methods have been proposed for such problems more recently, where the prior takes care of the sparsity structure. These methods have the natural ability to also automatically quantify the uncertainty of the inference through the posterior distribution. Theoretical studies of Bayesian procedures in high-dimension have been carried out recently. Questions that arise are whether the posterior distribution contracts near the true value of the parameter at the minimax optimal rate, whether the correct lower-dimensional structure is discovered with high posterior probability, and if a credible region has adequate frequentist coverage. In this paper, we review the properties of Bayesian and related methods for several high-dimensional models such as many normal means problem, linear regression, generalized linear models, Gaussian and non-Gaussian graphical models. Effective computational approaches are also discussed.},

This study focuses on comparing the causal anatomies of multiple treatments through the use of causal mediation analysis. It proposes a novel set of comparative causal mediation (CCM) estimands that compare the mediation effects of different treatments via a common mediator. Further, it derives the properties of a set of estimators for the CCM estimands and shows these estimators to be consistent (or conservative) under assumptions that do not require the absence of unobserved confounding of the mediator\textendash outcome relationship, which is a strong and nonrefutable assumption that must typically be made for consistent estimation of individual causal mediation effects. To illustrate the method, the study presents an original application investigating whether and how the international legal status of a foreign policy commitment can increase the domestic political ``audience costs'' that democratic governments suffer for violating such a commitment. The results provide novel evidence that international legalization can enhance audience costs via multiple causal channels, including by amplifying the perceived immorality of violating the commitment.},

  abstract = {We are currently witnessing the emergence of new forms of collective identities and a redefinition of the old ones through networked digital interactions, and these can be explicitly measured and analyzed. We distinguish between three major trends on the development of the concept of identity in the social realm: (1) an essentialist sense (based on conditions and properties shared by members of a group), (2) a representational or ideational sense (based on the application of categories by oneself or others), and (3) a relational and interactional sense (based on interaction processes between actors and their environments). The interactional approach aligns with current empirical and methodological progress in social network analysis. Moreover, it has been argued that, within the network society, the notion of collective identity (Melucci, 1995) in the political field must be rethought as technologically mediated and interactive. We suggest that collective identities should be understood as recurrent, cohesive, and coordinated communicative interaction networks. We here propose that such identities can be depicted by: (a) mapping and filtering a relevant interaction network, (b) delimiting a set of communities, (c) determining the strongly connected component(s) of such communities (the core identity) in a directed graph, and (d) defining the identity audiences and sources within the community. This technical graph\textendash theoretical characterization is explained and justified in detail through a toy model and applied to three empirical case studies to characterize political identities in party politics (communicative interaction in Twitter during the Spanish elections in 2018), contentious politics in confrontation (in Twitter during the Catalan strike for independence 2019), and the multitudinous identity of Spanish Indignados/15 social movement (in Facebook fan pages 2011). We discuss how the proposed definition is useful to delimit and characterize the internal structure of collective identities in technopolitical interaction networks, and we suggest how the proposed methods can be improved and complemented with other approaches. We finally draw the theoretical implications of understanding collective identities as emerging from interaction networks in a progressive platformization of social interactions in a digital world.},

This paper aims to explore this gap. It distinguishes between two ways in which voters' structure of attitudes might be different from that of elites: insufficient thinking around issues, and the use of different schemes of thinking around political objects. Results from the European Election Study show that the two logics co-exist in European Union societies. They also demonstrate that the latter is associated with voters' lower levels of satisfaction with the functioning of democracy, even after controlling for political engagement, distance to closest party and need to engage in trade-offs.},

In particular, it is relevant for political deliberation and other group decision-making processes. Although previous research has reported different approaches to model social dynamics, most of them focused on interaction mechanisms where individuals modify their opinions in line with the opinions of others, without invoking a latent mechanism of argumentation. In this paper, we present a model where changes of opinion are due to explicit exchanges of arguments, and we analyze the emerging collective states in terms of simple dynamic rules. We find that, when interactions are equiprobable and symmetrical, the model only shows consensus solutions. However, when either homophily, confirmation bias, or both are included, we observe the emergence and dominance of bipolarization, which appears due to the fact that individuals are not able to accept the contrary information from their opponents during exchanges of arguments. In all cases, the predominance of each stable state depends on the relation between the number of agents and the number of available arguments in the discussion. Overall, this paper describes the dynamics and shows the conditions wherein deliberative agents are expected to construct polarized societies.},

Using few assumptions, we provide two change-points consistency theorems. Those are the first in the context of unknown number of change-points detection in time-varying Ising model.

This question, first posed by May in 1972, captures a long standing challenge, fueled by a seeming contradiction between theory and practice. While empirical reality answers with an astounding yes, the mathematical analysis, based on linear stability theory, seems to suggest the contrary - hence, the diversity-stability paradox. Here we settle this dichotomy, by considering the interplay between topology and dynamics. We show that this interplay leads to the emergence of non-random patterns in the system's stability matrix, leading us to relinquish the prevailing random matrix-based paradigm. Instead, we offer a new matrix ensemble, which captures the dynamic stability of real-world systems. This ensemble helps us analytically identify the relevant control parameters that predict a system's stability, exposing three broad dynamic classes: In the asymptotically unstable class, diversity, indeed, leads to instability a la May's paradox. However, we also expose an asymptotically stable class, the class in which most real systems reside, in which diversity not only does not prohibit, but, in fact, enhances dynamic stability. Finally, in the sensitively stable class diversity plays no role, and hence stability is driven by the system's microscopic parameters. Together, our theory uncovers the naturally emerging rules of complex system stability, helping us reconcile the paradox that has eluded us for decades.},

To account for this impact, we automatically map local meaning structures\textemdash ensembles of semantic associations embedded in specific social groups\textemdash to identify the focal elements of these meaning structures, and qualitatively examine contextual usage of such elements.

  abstract = {The complexity of many biological, social and technological systems stems from the richness of the interactions among their units. Over the past decades, a great variety of complex systems has been successfully described as networks whose interacting pairs of nodes are connected by links. Yet, in face-to-face human communication, chemical reactions and ecological systems, interactions can occur in groups of three or more nodes and cannot be simply described just in terms of simple dyads. Until recently, little attention has been devoted to the higher-order architecture of real complex systems. However, a mounting body of evidence is showing that taking the higher-order structure of these systems into account can greatly enhance our modeling capacities and help us to understand and predict their emerging dynamical behaviors. Here, we present a complete overview of the emerging field of networks beyond pairwise interactions. We first discuss the methods to represent higher-order interactions and give a unified presentation of the different frameworks used to describe higher-order systems, highlighting the links between the existing concepts and representations. We review the measures designed to characterize the structure of these systems and the models proposed in the literature to generate synthetic structures, such as random and growing simplicial complexes, bipartite graphs and hypergraphs. We introduce and discuss the rapidly growing research on higher-order dynamical systems and on dynamical topology. We focus on novel emergent phenomena characterizing landmark dynamical processes, such as diffusion, spreading, synchronization and games, when extended beyond pairwise interactions. We elucidate the relations between higher-order topology and dynamical properties, and conclude with a summary of empirical applications, providing an outlook on current modeling and conceptual frontiers.},

We present such an approach for multi-party electoral systems, focusing on probabilities of coalition majorities. A Monte Carlo approach based on a Bayesian Multinomial-Dirichlet model is used for estimation. Probabilities are estimated, assuming the election was held today ("now-cast"), not accounting for potential shifts in the electorate until election day ("fore-cast"). Since our method is based on the posterior distribution of party shares, the approach can be used to answer a variety of questions related to the outcome of an election. We also introduce visualization techniques that facilitate a more adequate depiction of relevant quantities as well as respective uncertainties. The benefits of our approach are discussed by application to the German federal elections in 2013 and 2017.

Drawing on pooled cross-sectional data from the European Social Survey for the period 2002\textendash 2016, we find that confidence in the EP has not only declined over time but also polarized, since citizens have increasingly moved away from the ``average citizen''. This polarizing trend has occurred especially in peripheral EU member states that suffered the most from the economic crisis. Furthermore, we find that trust has polarized especially among the young versus the elderly and the employed versus the unemployed.

Inspired by skew coordinate systems recently proposed in natural language processing models, we solidify these intuitions in a formalism where opinions evolve in a multidimensional space where topics form a non-orthogonal basis.

For two antagonistic stubborn agents we investigate the opinion heterogeneity of the emerging non-consensus states and describe their statistical properties using a graph metric similar to the resistance distance in electrical networks. Applying the model to synthetic and empirical networks we find while opinion diversity is decreased by small-worldness and favored in the case of a pronounced community structure the opposite is true for the coherence of opinions during a consensus change.},

As a result, these websites have become valuable knowledge repositories, covering a wealth of topics related to particular programming languages. This knowledge is even more useful as the developer community evaluates both questions and answers through a voting mechanism. As votes accumulate, the developer community recognizes reputed members and further trusts their answers. In this paper, we analyze the community's questions and answers to determine the developers' personality traits, using the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC). We explore the personality traits of StackOverflow authors by categorizing them into different categories based on their reputation. Through textual analysis of StackOverflow posts, we found that the top reputed authors are more extroverted compared to medium and low reputed users. Moreover, authors of up voted posts express significantly less negative emotions than authors of down voted posts.},

Four main experiments and six supplemental studies (total N = 3684) demonstrate that people prefer to direct persuasion efforts toward individuals who seem poised to shift their attitudes qualitatively (e.g., from negative to positive) rather than non-qualitatively (e.g., from positive to more positive). This preference stems from the fact that qualitative attitude change is perceived as greater in magnitude and expected to have a larger impact on behavior. These findings provide initial insight into the factors that drive persuasion target selection, and are inconsistent with what past persuasion research, conventional marketing wisdom, and our empirical evidence suggests persuaders should do. People tend to select persuasion targets they believe they can change qualitatively, but at least sometimes can have greater persuasive impact by targeting individuals who are already leaning in their direction.},

This letter demonstrates that a linear specification averages the estimates for all the homogeneous outcome groups (which, by definition, all have slope coefficients of zero) with the slope coefficients for the groups with a mix of zeros and ones. The correct comparison of the linear to logit form is to only look at groups with some variation in the dependent variable. Researchers using the linear specification are urged to report results for all groups and for the subset of groups where the dependent variable varies. The interpretation of the difference between these two results depends upon assumptions which cannot be empirically assessed.},

In this chapter, we first track the how the history of both nomothetic idiographic perspectives impacted the study of personality structure and dynamics. Next, we review findings and unanswered contemporary questions regarding nomothetic and idiographic structure, processes, and dynamics. Finally, we conclude by arguing for an idiographic network approach to understanding personality based in dynamic systems theory. We provide both theoretical questions for future research, some of which were proposed by early personality theorists but progressed slowly due to a lack of adequate methods, as well as cutting-edge techniques for actually testing them.

  abstract = {We consider an approach for community detection in time-varying networks. At its core, this approach maintains a small sketch graph to capture the essential community structure found in each snapshot of the full network. We demonstrate how the sketch can be used to explicitly identify six key community events which typically occur during network evolution: growth, shrinkage, merging, splitting, birth and death. Based on these detection techniques, we formulate a community detection algorithm which can process a network concurrently exhibiting all processes. One advantage afforded by the sketch-based algorithm is the efficient handling of large networks. Whereas detecting events in the full graph may be computationally expensive, the small size of the sketch allows changes to be quickly assessed. A second advantage occurs in networks containing clusters of disproportionate size. The sketch is constructed such that there is equal representation of each cluster, thus reducing the possibility that the small clusters are lost in the estimate. We present a new standardized benchmark based on the stochastic block model which models the addition and deletion of nodes, as well as the birth and death of communities. When coupled with existing benchmarks, this new benchmark provides a comprehensive suite of tests encompassing all six community events. We provide a set of numerical results demonstrating the advantages of our approach both in run time and in the handling of small clusters.},

Confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) of the properties of some of the instruments have revealed that three pairs of values were excessively highly correlated. This led Davidov et al. (2008) to propose unifying values. To overcome the problems of loss of precision due to unifying distinct values, Knoppen and Saris (2009a,b) investigated the factorial structure of each of the ten values measured with the PVQ (Schwartz et al. 2001). They identified both cross-loadings and distinct sub-dimensions for the pairs of nondiscriminated values in two German student samples. They concluded that the original strategy for selecting items, maximizing theoretical coverage at the expense of item homogeneity, produced the poor discrimination between values. Our Study 1 examines whether the Knoppen and Saris findings generalize to a representative sample of the German population. With some notable exceptions, our findings replicate theirs. Study 2 uses 33 items from an experimental version of the PVQ to operationalize and test a full model of the 11 basic values. Following Knoppen and Saris, we included only one sub-dimension of each of the 11 values. This CFA model yielded a satisfactory fit with no estimation problems. We conclude that available indicators permit measuring the distinct values without the need to collapse factors. Limitations and implications of the research are discussed.},

More recently, researchers have begun to study the differing access to information of individuals within a network. This previous work suggests that information access is itself a potential aspect of privilege based on network position. While concerns about fairness usually focus on differences between demographic groups, characterizing network position may itself give rise to new groups for study. But how do we characterize position? Rather than using standard grouping methods for graph clustering, we design and explore a clustering that explicitly incorporates models of how information flows on a network. Our goal is to identify clusters of nodes that are similar based on their access to information across the network. We show, both formally and experimentally, that the resulting clustering method is a new approach to network clustering. Using a wide variety of datasets, our experiments show that the introduced clustering technique clusters individuals together who are similar based on an external information access measure.},

OBJECTIVE To assess the assumptions made by the HAPC model, and the situations in which it does and does not work. METHODS Simulation study. Simulation scenarios assess the effect of (a) cohort trends in the Data Generating Process (DGP) (compared to only random variation), and (b) grouping cohorts (in both DGP and fitted model). RESULTS The model only works if either (a) we can assume that there are no linear (or non-linear) trends in periods or cohorts, (b) we control any cohort trend in the model\&\#x2019;s fixed part and assume there is no period trend, or (c) we group cohorts in such a way that they exactly match the groupings in the (unknown) DGP. Otherwise, the model can arbitrarily reapportion APC effects, radically impacting interpretation. CONCLUSIONS Since the purpose of APC analysis is often to ascertain the presence of period and/or cohort trends, and since we rarely have solid (if any) theory regarding cohort groupings, there are few circumstances in which this model achieves what Yang and Land claim it can. The results bring into question findings of several published studies using the HAPC model. However, the structure of the model remains a conceptual advance that is useful when we can assume the DGP has no period trends.]},

Using pooled cross-sectional data for ten post-communist countries spanning twenty-five years and a dynamic model specification, the study shows that, contrary to what the institutionalist theory predicts, post-communist democratic governments redistribute about 0.6 percent less of their GDP on social protection in the short term and 1.3 percent less in the long term than post-communist autocrats do. However, consistent with the cultural legacies hypothesis, there are no differences when it comes to redistribution of life chances through health care and education. I attribute the finding that post-communist autocracies redistribute more via social spending and are reluctant to liberalize their welfare states to their need to maintain popular legitimacy in a region where citizens are accustomed to high levels of redistribution and popular protests often lead to regime turnover. I argue that post-communist democracies have other available mechanisms to maintain their legitimacy, namely, free and fair elections, while post-communist autocratic governments have to rely on redistribution to do so. The findings have implications for our understanding of authoritarian resilience in the region.},

Statistical results were combined with qualitative evidence of response processes from cognitive interviewing (CI). These integrated results yielded a coherent picture of bias sources. Nonuniform DIF was linked to differences in the response processes, whereas uniform DIF was associated with differential meaning of the item contents.

Analyzing the structure of the projected graph is common, but we do not have a good understanding of the consequences of the projection on such analyses. Here, we propose and analyze a random graph model to study what properties we can expect from the projection step. Our model is based on a Chung-Lu random graph for constructing the bipartite representation, which enables us to rigorously analyze the projected graph. We show that common network properties such as sparsity, heavy-tailed degree distributions, local clustering at nodes, the inverse relationship between node degree, and global transitivity can be explained and analyzed through this simple model. We also develop a fast sampling algorithm for our model, which we show is provably optimal for certain input distributions. Numerical simulations where model parameters come from real-world datasets show that much of the clustering behavior in some datasets can just be explained by the projection step.},

  abstract = {In online social networks, it is common to use predictions of node categories to estimate measures of homophily and other relational properties. However, online social network data often lacks basic demographic information about the nodes. Researchers must rely on predicted node attributes to estimate measures of homophily, but little is known about the validity of these measures. We show that estimating homophily in a network can be viewed as a dyadic prediction problem, and that homophily estimates are unbiased when dyad-level residuals sum to zero in the network. Node-level prediction models, such as the use of names to classify ethnicity or gender, do not generally have this property and can introduce large biases into homophily estimates. Bias occurs due to error autocorrelation along dyads. Importantly, node-level classification performance is not a reliable indicator of estimation accuracy for homophily. We compare estimation strategies that make predictions at the node and dyad levels, evaluating performance in different settings. We propose a novel ``ego-alter'' modeling approach that outperforms standard node and dyad classification strategies. While this paper focuses on homophily, results generalize to other relational measures which aggregate predictions along the dyads in a network. We conclude with suggestions for research designs to study homophily in online networks. Code for this paper is available at https://github.com/georgeberry/autocorr.},

Understanding how such simple individual characteristics may emerge from potentially much more complex agents is thus a natural question. It has been proposed recently in [E. Bertin, P. Jensen, C.R. Phys. 20, 329 (2019)] that some types of interactions among agents with many internal degrees of freedom may lead to a `simplification' of agents, which are then effectively described by a small number of internal degrees of freedom. Here, we generalize the model to account for agents intrinsic heterogeneity. We find two different simplification regimes, one dominated by interactions, where agents become simple and identical as in the homogeneous model, and one where agents remain strongly heterogeneous although effectively having simple characteristics.},

  abstract = {We introduce a socially motivated extension of the voter model in which individual voters are also influenced by two opposing, fixed-opinion news sources. These sources forestall consensus and instead drive the population to a politically polarized state, with roughly half the population in each opinion state. Two types of social networks for the voters are studied: (a) the complete graph of N voters and, more realistically, (b) the two-clique graph with N voters in each clique. For the complete graph, many dynamical properties are soluble within an annealed-link approximation, in which a link between a news source and a voter is replaced by an average link density. In this approximation, we show that the average consensus time grows as , with . Here p is the probability that a voter consults a news source rather than a neighboring voter, and is the link density between a news source and voters, so that can be greater than 1. The polarization time, namely, the time to reach a politically polarized state from an initial strong majority state, is typically much less than the consensus time. For voters on the two-clique graph, either reducing the density of interclique links or enhancing the influence of news sources again promotes polarization.},

  abstract = {Classical causal and statistical inference methods typically assume the observed data consists of independent realizations. However, in many applications this assumption is inappropriate due to a network of dependences between units in the data. Methods for estimating causal effects have been developed in the setting where the structure of dependence between units is known exactly, but in practice there is often substantial uncertainty about the precise network structure. This is true, for example, in trial data drawn from vulnerable communities where social ties are difficult to query directly. In this paper we combine techniques from the structure learning and interference literatures in causal inference, proposing a general method for estimating causal effects under data dependence when the structure of this dependence is not known a priori. We demonstrate the utility of our method on synthetic datasets which exhibit network dependence.},

  abstract = {The countries of the Western Balkans during the 1990s were dominated by competitive authoritarian regimes that combined multi-party elections with nationalist rhetoric and the privatisation of the state to affiliated business interests. After a move towards democratisation in the early 2000s across the region, authoritarian practices began re-appearing in the late 2000s and have now firmly taken root in many of these countries. This article will argue that the current competitive authoritarian systems (Levitsky, Steven, and Lucan A. Way. 2010. Competitive Authoritarianism. Hybrid Regimes after the Cold War. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press) are structurally different from those of the 1990s. These new regimes draw on the failure of reformist governments during the early 2000s to decisively break with authoritarian practices and establish independent and democratic institutions, thus facilitating the return of competitive authoritarian regimes. The current pattern in the Western Balkans is part of a global trend, but is also one embedded in the particularities of democratic transformation of the region. This article argues that the return of competitive authoritarianism is the result of weak democratic structures, facilitated by the weakening and insufficient transformative power of external actors, first and foremost the EU, in incentivizing continued democratisation.},

Specifically, we identify which assumptions regarding individual-level adjustment behavior in terms of optimal play (`best response') and deviations thereof (`noise') are supported. In doing so, we move the focus of research from the theoretical and modeling question `How Noise Matters?' (Blume, 2003) to the behavioral and empirical question `What Noise Matters?'.},

When individuals differ in their responses to treatment, three types of inequality may result. Treatment may shape inequalities between subgroups defined by pretreatment covariates, it may induce more inequality in one subgroup than another, or it may polarize people across multiple dimensions of well-being. We introduce a model, called a covariance regression, that captures all three types of inequality via the means, variances, and correlations between multiple outcomes. The model can test for heterogeneous treatment effects, quantify the heterogeneity, and explain its structure using covariates. Finding that a treatment creates inequalities could drive theoretical refinement and inform policy decisions (targeting groups where payoffs will be most predictable). We illustrate the utility of covariance regressions by analyzing the effects of sharing information about income inequality on redistributive preferences.},

In their applications, the within-individual residuals are often assumed to be independent with constant variance across time, an assumption that implies that the assumed growth function fully accounts for the dependencies and patterns of variation in the data. Studies have shown that a poorly specified within-individual residual covariance structure of a linear mixed-effects model can impact the estimated covariance matrix of the random effects at the second-level, model fit and statistical inference. The consequences for nonlinear mixed-effects models are not, however, clearly understood. This is due in part to the differences in the estimation needs of the two types of models. Using empirical data examples, this work illustrates the impact of fitting alternative residual covariance structures in nonlinear mixed-effects models that do not entirely parallel the results from studies of strictly linear mixed-effects models and call for the need of researchers to consider alternative structures when fitting nonlinear mixed-effects models.},

  abstract = {A popular approach for understanding complex systems is a network analytic one: the system's entities and their interactions are represented by a graph structure such that readily available methods suitable for graph structures can be applied. A network representation of a system enables the analysis of indirect effects: if A has an impact on B, and B has an impact on C, then, A also has an impact on C. This is often due to some kind of process flowing through the network, for example, pieces of informations or viral infections in social systems, passenger flows in transportation systems, or traded goods in economic systems. We argue that taking into account the actual usage of the system additionally to the static network representation of the system can yield interesting insights: first, the network representation and applicable network methods cannot be chosen independently from the network process of interest (Borgatti 2005; Dorn et al. 2012; Zweig 2016; Butts 2009). Therefore, focussing on the relevant network process in an early stage of the research project helps to determine suitable network representations and methods in order to obtain meaningful results (we call this approach process-driven network analysis). Second, many network methods assume that the spreading of some entity follows shortest or random paths. However, we show that not all flows are well approximated by this. In these cases, incorporating the network usage creates a real addition of knowledge to the static aggregated network representation.},

Societies are increasingly reliant on digital technologies to collect data; sort, rank and filter users and information in order to ease communication, commerce, or collaboration. This paper considers the impact of these digital practices on the interpersonal and institutional logics of trust production. The first part of the paper argues that globalization and digitalization unleashed a trust crisis, as the traditional institutional and interpersonal logics are not attuned to produce trust and manage distrust at the scale and speed of global networks of communication, media, finance, etc. In the second part, the paper describes how digital intermediation changes the traditional logics of interpersonal trust formation, and creates new trust mediating services. It also considers how old institutional forms of trust production are affected by the fact that these institutions employ digital technologies in their processes, and describes new, technological forms of institutional trust production. Finally, the paper asks the question: why should we trust these technological trust mediators? The analysis concludes at best, it is impossible to establish the trustworthiness trust mediators, at worst, we have no reason to trust them.},

Chaos describes certain nonlinear dynamical systems that have a very sensitive dependence on initial conditions. Chaotic systems are always deterministic and may be very simple, yet they produce completely unpredictable and divergent behavior. Systems of nonlinear equations are difficult to solve analytically, and scientists have relied heavily on visual and qualitative approaches to discover and analyze the dynamics of nonlinearity. Indeed, few fields have drawn as heavily from visualization methods for their seminal innovations: from strange attractors, to bifurcation diagrams, to cobweb plots, to phase diagrams and embedding. Although the social sciences are increasingly studying these types of systems, seminal concepts remain murky or loosely adopted. This article has three aims. First, it argues for several visualization methods to critically analyze and understand the behavior of nonlinear dynamical systems. Second, it uses these visualizations to introduce the foundations of nonlinear dynamics, chaos, fractals, self-similarity and the limits of prediction. Finally, it presents Pynamical, an open-source Python package to easily visualize and explore nonlinear dynamical systems' behavior.},

As shown in recent work, however, when target labels are error-prone, potential prediction unfairness can arise from measurement error. In this paper, we show that, when an error-prone proxy target is used, existing methods to assess and calibrate fairness criteria do not extend to the true target variable of interest. To remedy this problem, we suggest a framework resulting from the combination of two existing literatures: fair ML methods, such as those found in the counterfactual fairness literature on the one hand, and, on the other, measurement models found in the statistical literature. We discuss these approaches and their connection resulting in our framework. In a healthcare decision problem, we find that using a latent variable model to account for measurement error removes the unfairness detected previously.},

This article disaggregates the concept of democracy and proposes a novel multidimensional conceptualization to account for the variation in institutional configurations. Three dimensions are featured: participation, electoral contestation, and constraints on the executive. The three dimensions constitute a cube covering all regime types using V-Dem data from 1789 to 2017. Eckstein (1973) theorized that we should expect to see systematic patterns of institutional consistency, whereby sets of similar institutions occur together. Our multidimensional measure allows for a more comprehensive test of the Eckstein hypothesis. We find strong evidence to support Eckstein (1973). First, across the globe over 200 years, there are configurations of political institutions that never occur. In other words, incompatible institutional pairs do not exist or are extremely short lived. Second, we are able to differentiate political systems that appear similar along a unidimensional scale (e.g Hong Kong and Equador) but are in reality quite distinct. Third, we are able to trace historical patterns of democratization and autocratization (especially in the early stages of the development of democracy) using our cube of democracy patterns.},

The behavior of citizens with an active electoral right, but not participating in the voting (non-voters) can be compared with the behavior of a stowaway in public transport: even if he does not pay the fare, there will still be transport, because there are those who pay the fare. The non-voter does not participate in the creation, he only consumes. It is obvious that if nobody takes part in the elections, the foundations of democracy will collapse. Obliging to participate in elections can have both positive and negative effects on the development of civil society, raising the level of electoral and legal culture of the population, and developing state institutions. It is possible that the imposition of sanctions on mandatory elections may also reduce recognition of democracy. Ideas related to the possibility of deprivation of citizenship of those not participating in elections are critically evaluated. It is emphasized that there is insufficient evidence to judge the relationship between voter turnout and voting results. It is proposed to clearly affirm the obligation of state and municipal employees to participate in elections. If the level of citizenship and electoral culture of voters becomes higher, the issue of compulsory vote will lose its relevance. Voluntary voting is usually better than compulsory.},

This paper develops analytic conditions of when misspecifications affect Bollen's (1996) model implied instrumental variable, two stage least squares (MIIV-2SLS) estimator of a factor loading. It shows that if an indicator equation is correctly specified, then correlated errors among other measures, mixing up causal indicators with reflective, omitting cross loadings, and omitting direct effects between indicators leave the MIIV-2SLS estimator of the factor loading unchanged. Alternatively, if the indicator or the scaling indicator equation is misspecified, then the loading is unlikely to be robust. The results are illustrated with hypothetical and empirical examples.},

One way to obtain such information is to ask survey respondents to place actors on a common ideological scale, but, unfortunately, respondents typically display a set of biases when performing such placements. Key among these are rationalization bias and differential item functioning (DIF). While Aldrich-McKelvey (AM) scaling offers a useful solution to DIF, it ignores the issue of rationalization bias, and this study presents Monte Carlo simulations demonstrating that AM-type models thus can give inaccurate results. As a response to this challenge, this study develops an alternative Bayesian scaling approach, which simultaneously estimates DIF and rationalization bias, and therefore performs better when the latter bias is present.},

Despite long-term trends toward differentiated modes of interest intermediation, the results indicate that a wide range of parties does protest. However, in highly differentiated contexts, the typical protesting party mirrors the outsider image of movement parties: it does not belong to a mainstream party family and has no government experience. By contrast, more strategic factors, such as opposition status, drive parties to the streets in less differentiated contexts.},

Whereas latent variable approaches introduce unobserved common causes to explain the relations among observed variables, network approaches posit direct causal relations between observed variables. While these approaches lead to radically different understandings of the psychological constructs of interest, recent articles have established mathematical equivalences that hold between network models and latent variable models. We argue that the fact that for any model from one class there is an equivalent model from the other class does not mean that both models are equally plausible accounts of the data-generating mechanism. In many cases the constraints that are meaningful in one framework translate to constraints in the equivalent model that lack a clear interpretation in the other framework. Finally, we discuss three diverging predictions for the relation between zero-order correlations and partial correlations implied by sparse network models and unidimensional factor models. We propose a test procedure that compares the likelihoods of these models in light of these diverging implications. We use an empirical example to illustrate our argument.},

Second, the theorist constructs a proto-theory: a set of theoretical principles that potentially explain these phenomena. Third, the proto-theory is used to construct a formal model: a set of model equations or simulation models that encode the explanatory principles. Fourth, the theorist investigates this model's explanatory adequacy. This is done by formalizing the empirical phenomena in terms of the model, and assessing whether the model indeed reproduces them. Fifth, the theorist studies the overall adequacy of the theory by evaluating whether phenomena are indeed reproduced faithfully, whether explanatory principles are parsimonious and substantively plausible, and whether the theory implies new predictions to promote further research. We illustrate TCM with an example taken from the intelligence literature (the mutualism model of intelligence), discuss the place of TCM in the larger scheme of scientific research, and propose an outline for a university curriculum that can systematically educate psychologists in the process of theory formation.},

The combination of these ingredients gives rise to a collective memory effect, which is triggered by external information. In this paper we focus our attention on how this memory arises when the order of appearance of external news is random. We will show which characteristics a piece of news needs to have in order to be embedded in the society's memory. We will also provide an analytical way to measure how many information a society can remember when an extensive number of news items is presented.

In this manuscript, we develop a theoretical model of cultural schemas that is better able to support empirical work, including inferential, sensitizing, and operational uses. We propose a multilevel framework centered on a high-level definition of cultural schemas that is sufficiently broad to capture its major sociological uses but still sufficiently narrow to identify a set of cognitive phenomena with key functional properties in common: cultural schemas are socially shared heuristic representations deployable in automatic cognition. We use this conception to elaborate the main theoretical properties of cultural schemas, and to provide clear criteria that distinguish them from other cultural or cognitive elements. We then propose a series of concrete tests empirical scholarship can use to determine if these properties apply. We also demonstrate how this approach can identify potentially faulty theoretical inferences present in existing work. Then, moving to a lower level of analysis, we elaborate how cultural schemas can be algorithmically conceptualized in terms of their building blocks. This leads us to recommend improvements to methods for measuring cultural schemas. We conclude by proposing fruitful sensitizing questions for future scholarship.},

  abstract = {The last three decades or so of scholarly debates over the concept of ``civil society'' have been preoccupied with taxonomical questions. What ``counts'' as ``civil society,'' and why? How do we identify, measure, and potentially foster the kinds of salutary associations that will help ``make democracy work''? Do the market and for-profit organizations count? What about religious organizations or the family? Are quasi-political, state-sponsored institutions such as political parties, agencies, or trade's unions better understood as part of civil society or as appendages of the state? These debates hinge on a kind of geographical imaginary that often portrays civil society as a physical ``space,'' ``place,'' or ``location,'' located somewhere ``between'' family and state or ``outside'' of the market.{$<$}/simple-para{$>$} {$<$}simple-para id="abspara0015" view="all"{$>$}I begin by considering how Adam Smith\textemdash one of the forerunners of contemporary discussions of civil society\textemdash conceived of the virtue of civility. As I demonstrate through a consideration of Smith's comments on civility, the virtue of civility both resembles and differs from the virtue of justice in terms of its susceptibility to being articulated in general rules. Unlike the abstract rules that characterize justice, the practice of civility hinges on matters of finesse, savoir-faire, discernment, or taste that can't be fully captured as formal rules. Civility is, in Smith's terms, more akin to informal matters of ``style'' than to the rule-bound quality of ``justice.''{$<$}/simple-para{$>$} {$<$}simple-para id="abspara0020" view="all"{$>$}This examination of Smith's account of civility has significance for broader conceptual debates about civility by interrogating structural or geographical conceptions of civil society and suggesting instead that civil society is best understood in terms of its essential informality. Civil society is composed of human relationships that are neither as close and intimate as those of the family, with its emphasis on charity and magnanimity, nor as formal as those governed by the distant, abstract rules of citizenship and market economy. Rather, civil society\textemdash as I argue here\textemdash is constituted by a qualitatively distinct mode of human relationship that partakes of the informal, necessarily tacit dimensions of the virtue of civility.},

Here, we study this question in the context of collaborative problem-solving, which is central to a variety of domains from engineering and medicine to economics and social planning. We analyze the frequency of all three- and four-node subgraphs in diverse real problem-solving networks. The results reveal a strong association between a dynamic property of network subgraphs\textemdash synchronizability\textemdash and the frequency and significance of these subgraphs in problem-solving networks. In particular, we show that highly-synchronizable subgraphs are overrepresented in the networks, while poorly-synchronizable subgraphs are underrepresented, suggesting that dynamical properties affect their prevalence, and thus the global structure of networks. We propose the possibility that selective pressures that favor more synchronizable subgraphs could account for their abundance in problem-solving networks. The empirical results also show that unrelated problem-solving networks display very similar local network structure, implying that network subgraphs could represent organizational routines that enable better coordination and control of problem-solving activities. The findings could also have potential implications in understanding the functionality of network subgraphs in other information-processing networks, including biological and social networks.},

  abstract = {Political actors often resort to electoral violence in order to gain an edge over their competitors even though violence is much harder to hide than fraud and more likely to delegitimize elections as a result. The existing literature tends to treat violence and fraud as equivalent strategies or to treat violence as a means of last resorts due to its overtness. We argue, in contrast, that violence is neither and, in fact, that political actors often use violence for the very reason that it is hard to hide. Its overtness, we argue, allows political actors to observe whether the agents they enlist to manipulate elections for them do so and reduces these agents' likelihood of shirking in turn. We develop our argument through a formal model, illustrating how increasing incentives to shirk due to electoral monitoring induces actors to use violence, and use process tracing to test the implications of this model through the example of pre-2011 Egypt.},

The author examined the status-legitimacy hypothesis using data from 3 representative sets of data from the United States (American National Election Studies and General Social Surveys) and throughout the world (World Values Survey; total N across studies = 151,794). Multilevel models revealed that the average effect across years in the United States and countries throughout the world was most often directly contrary to the status-legitimacy hypothesis or was practically zero. In short, the status-legitimacy effect is not a robust phenomenon. Two theoretically relevant moderator variables (inequality and civil liberties) were also tested, revealing weak evidence, null evidence, or contrary evidence to the dissonance-inspired status-legitimacy hypothesis. In sum, the status-legitimacy effect is not robust and is unlikely to be the result of dissonance. These results are used to discuss future directions for research, the current state of SJT, and the interpretation of theoretically relevant but contrary and null results.},

Betweenness, closeness, and strength centrality estimates are more unstable. Belief system networks estimated with smaller samples or in countries with more unstable political systems tend to be less reliable than networks estimated with larger samples in stable political systems. Although these analyses are restricted to the items available in the World Values Survey, they show that belief system networks can be reliable, but that this reliability is related to features of the study design and the political system.}

Symbolic components were also closer than operational components in the network to self-reported voting (d = -2.28) and environmental behaviors (d's = -1.62 and -1.54).

It discusses the approach of the European Social Survey (ESS) for monitoring fieldwork cross-nationally, and specifically, the improvements made to central monitoring with the introduction of the Fieldwork Management System (FMS). Through real-life examples of the use of FMS by the central team, the article reflects and discusses the impact of the changes to fieldwork monitoring. The ESS experience demonstrates that there is more than one way to realise the benefits of improved fieldwork data management and provides insights about the process of improving central monitoring of fieldwork for other cross-national surveys.},

Second, the history of attitude-behavior correspondence can be organized also around three broad themes: an early period in which the presumed close association between attitudes and behaviors was largely an article of faith; a middle period in which some researchers concluded that little, if any, relationship existed between measures of attitudes and overt behaviors; and a more recent period in which the resolution of prior issues stimulated an explosion of research focused on identifying the moderators and psychological mechanisms responsible for attitude-behavior correspondence. Finally, the history of research and ideas regarding attitude change and persuasion can be organized around several prominent theories focused on distinct single processes, dual processes, or multiple processes, each of which are still used by contemporary attitudes researchers.},

In the second part, we study the question on how general trust can be established in societies that are becoming more individualistic. The theory known as organic solidarity argues that division of labor is one of the key foundations of trust and solidarity between people. This proposition is studied by quantifying aspects of the division of labor. We show that these aspects are strongly related to general trust.},

In this regard as well as discussing existing work, there is some new research on the applicability and robustness of current models with respect to using them to model real populations. This is an important potential advance, as previously all of the work has been entirely theoretical. In particular, the most complex models will have many parameters, and we concentrate on considering simpler versions with a small number of parameters which still possess the key features which would make them applicable. We find that these models are generally robust, in particular issues that can arise related to small payoff changes at critical values and removal of pivotal vertices would have similar effects on other modelling system including evolutionary graph theory. These often occur where it can be argued that there is a lack of robustness in the real system that the model faithfully picks up, and so is not a problematic feature.},

Immediately thereafter, the new national government started to extend Piedmontese laws to the new nation's southern regions, introducing conscription and heavy taxation. The institutions and body politics of the pre-unification Italian states differed considerably. The new state centralized governmental power to level those differences. The southern people, were subjected to heavy-handed coercion, if not exploitation. The paper focuses on the coercion imposed by fiscal policies on the South. It asks whether coercion from the center was attenuated by redistribution operated at the regional and, especially, at the personal level with a focus on the poor. The answers confirm that fiscal coercion was indeed formidable. The Italian state imposed a heavy tax burden on the poor of all regions. When public expenditure also is brought in the picture, the poor in the southern regions remained disadvantaged, but less than they were before unification.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Immediately thereafter, the new national government started to extend Piedmontese laws to the new nation's southern regions, introducing conscription and heavy taxation. The institutions and body politics of the pre-unification Italian states differed considerably. The new state centralized governmental power to level those differences. The southern people, were subjected to heavy-handed coercion, if not exploitation. The paper focuses on the coercion imposed by fiscal policies on the South. It asks whether coercion from the center was attenuated by redistribution operated at the regional and, especially, at the personal level with a focus on the poor. The answers confirm that fiscal coercion was indeed formidable. The Italian state imposed a heavy tax burden on the poor of all regions. When public expenditure also is brought in the picture, the poor in the southern regions remained disadvantaged, but less than they were before unification.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Conventional wisdom tells us that as Europe has secularised, the effect of religion on party choice should also have diminished. Yet, this cross-national and cross-temporal study of religious voting in European elections from 1989 to 2004 paints a more nuanced picture. It shows that a) the effect of religion has been declining, but has increased in recent years, b) religion matters in particular for voting for Christian Democratic parties and Conservative parties, c) while generational replacement reduces the overall effect of religion on electoral decisions, the effect of religion has recently increased within each generation, and d) the impact of religion depends on the religious context in which citizens live so that religion plays a bigger role in fractionalised societies. These findings are discussed in the light of a revived importance of religion for European politics.},

Even though some of the historical foundations for certain types of blockmodelling stem from the psychological literature, applications of deterministic blockmodelling in psychological research are relatively rare. This scarcity is potentially attributable to three factors: a general unfamiliarity with relevant blockmodelling methods and applications; a lack of awareness of the value of partitioning network data for understanding group structures and processes; and the unavailability of such methods on software platforms familiar to most psychological researchers. To tackle the first two items, we provide a tutorial presenting a general framework for blockmodelling and describe two of the most important types of deterministic blockmodelling applications relevant to psychological research: structural balance partitioning and two-mode partitioning based on structural equivalence. To address the third problem, we developed a suite of software programs that are available as both Fortran executable files and compiled Fortran dynamic-link libraries that can be implemented in the R software system. We demonstrate these software programs using networks from the literature.},

  abstract = {During the past 5 to 10 years, an estimation method known as eLasso has been used extensively to produce symptom networks (or, more precisely, symptom dependence graphs) from binary data in psychopathological research. The eLasso method is based on a particular type of Ising model that corresponds to binary pairwise Markov random fields, and its popularity is due, in part, to an efficient estimation process that is based on a series of l{$_1$}-regularized logistic regressions. In this article, we offer an unprecedented critique of the Ising model and eLasso. We provide a careful assessment of the conditions that underlie the Ising model as well as specific limitations associated with the eLasso estimation algorithm. This assessment leads to serious concerns regarding the implementation of eLasso in psychopathological research. Some potential strategies for eliminating or, at least, mitigating these concerns include (a) the use of partitioning or mixture modeling to account for unobserved heterogeneity in the sample of respondents, and (b) the use of co-occurrence measures for symptom similarity to either replace or supplement the covariance/correlation measure associated with eLasso. Two psychopathological data sets are used to highlight the concerns that are raised in the critique. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

The purpose of this paper is to examine whether their excluded counterparts can be polarized by exposure to political information on the internet. Design/methodology/approach Quantile regression and visual analysis of raw data from the online and face-to-face samples in the 2012 and 2016 American National Election Studies (n=9,563) assessed the impact of online political information on opinion polarization among ideological moderates, political Independents, respondents without a college degree, and those with low interest in politics. Findings Exposure to online political information during the survey was associated with significant polarizing shifts toward more consistent ideological positions in all four groups. Practical implications Engaging the middle is a social justice issue as much as a matter of political conflict, and evidence suggests that politically excluded groups use the internet to translate their own views into the language of policy opinions and popular (polarized) politics. Recommended policy interventions include information literacy programs. Further research should use experimental models and browser histories. Originality/value Current research on political polarization leaves open the question of whether larger portions of the electorate are available to join the fray. This study shows that excluded publics can be polarized via exposure to online information.},

A total of three approaches (MGCFA for ordinal and continuous data, multi-group IRT) were applied to simulated data containing different types and extents of MI violations, and to the empirical non-cognitive PISA 2015 data. Analyses are based on indices of the magnitude (i.e., parameter-specific modification indices resulting from MGCFA and group-specific item fit statistics resulting from the IRT approach) and direction of local misfit (i.e., standardized parameter change and mean deviation, respectively). Results indicate that all measures were sensitive to (some) MI violations and more consistent in identifying group differences in item difficulty parameters.},

These null eigenvalues are caused by duplication mechanisms leading to structures with local symmetries which should be more present in complex organizations. The associated eigenvectors of these states are strongly localized. We then evaluate these microstructures in the context of quantum mechanics, demonstrating the previously mentioned localization by studying the spread of continuous-time quantum walks. This null-eigenvalue localization is essentially different from the Anderson localization in the following points: first, the eigenvalues do not lie on the edges of the density of states but at its center; second, the eigenstates do not decay exponentially and do not leak out of the symmetric structures. In this sense, it is closer to the bound state in continuum.},

Crowdsourcing projects harness information from large crowds of citizens who voluntarily participate into one collaborative project, and allow new insights into people's attitudes and perceptions. However, these are usually affected by a series of biases that limit their representativeness (i.e. self-selection bias, unequal participation, underrepresentation of certain areas and times). In this chapter we present a two-step method aimed to produce reliable small area estimates from crowdsourced data when no auxiliary information is available at the individual level. A non-parametric bootstrap, aimed to compute pseudosampling weights and bootstrap weighted estimates, is followed by an area-level modelbased small area estimation approach, which borrows strength from related areas based on a set of covariates, to improve the small area estimates. In order to assess the method, a simulation study and an application to safety perceptions in Greater London are conducted. The simulation study shows that the area-level model-based small area estimator under the non-parametric bootstrap improves (in terms of bias and variability) the small area estimates in the majority of areas. The application produces estimates of safety perceptions at a small geographical level in Greater London from Place Pulse 2.0 data. In the application, estimates are validated externally by comparing these to reliable survey estimates. Further simulation experiments and applications are needed to examine whether this method also improves the small area estimates when the sample biases are larger, smaller or show different distributions. A measure of reliability also needs to be developed to estimate the error of the small area estimates under the non-parametric bootstrap.},

There are two main characteristics the models take into account, namely a network structure of interactions, which we treat by an appropriate mesoscopic description, and a different role of interacting agents. The latter differs from interactions treated in classical statistical mechanics in the sense that the agents do not have symmetric roles, but there is rather an active and a passive agent. We will demonstrate how a certain form of kinetic equations can be obtained to describe such interactions at a mesoscopic level and moreover obtain macroscopic models from monokinetics solutions of those. The derivation naturally leads to systems of nonlocal reaction-diffusion equations (or in a suitable limit local versions thereof), which can explain spatial phase separation phenomena found to emerge from the microscopic interactions. We will highlight the approach in three examples, namely the evolution and coarsening of dialects in human language, the construction of social norms, and the spread of an epidemic.},

As such, these models may be unable to capture complex dynamics resulting from multiple interrelated traits. Here we put forward a systems approach to cultural evolutionary research\textemdash one that explicitly represents numerous cultural traits and their relationships to one another. Basing our discussion on simple graph-based models, we examine the implications of the systems approach in four domains: (i) the cultural evolution of decision rules (`filters') and their influence on the distribution of cultural traits in a population; (ii) the contingency and stochasticity of system trajectories through a structured state space; (iii) how trait interrelationships can modulate rates of cultural change; and (iv) how trait interrelationships can contribute to understandings of inter-group differences in realised traits. We suggest that the preliminary results presented here should inspire greater attention to the role of multiple interrelated traits on cultural evolution, and should motivate attempts to formalise the rich body of analyses and hypotheses within the humanities and social science literatures.},

The study is an elaboration of models developed in earlier papers using iterated games [Weesie, J., Buskens, V., Raub, W., 1998. The management of trust relations via institutional and structural embeddedness. Journal of Mathematical Sociology (in press); Buskens, V., 1995. Social Networks and the Effect of Reputation on Cooperation. ISCORE Paper No. 42, Utrecht University]. We distinguish individual and group network measures. Applying a combination of approximation methods to the game-theoretic solution to the model, we derive hypotheses on the effects of density, outdegree centrality, and centralization on the level of trust a trustor can have in a trustee. We conclude that higher density and outdegree induce more trust. Centralization increases trust if it is `well organized,' i.e., actors who can place more trust are central in the network. Furthermore, we discuss theoretical evidence that the relative importance of density compared to outdegree increases if the trust problem at the dyadic level is large. Finally, we show that, in many situations, a few simple network measures explain most of the effects of the network structure as a whole.},

  abstract = {Background New food technologies developed by producers who want to spread their innovation require potential new adopters to receive information about the innovation as well as to develop trust about the appropriateness and quality of the new technology. Social networks are key for spreading information and for developing trust. In this essay, I will summarize sociological knowledge about how the structure of social networks can accelerate or inhibit innovation diffusion among consumers. Scope and approach Innovation adoption is mostly a multistage process in which potential adopters/consumers need to obtain information first. A second step towards adoption is developing appreciation for the advantages of the innovation. A third step is the development of trust that the new product or technology indeed brings the advantages that it promises. I will explain based on existing literature why and in what manner, different structural properties of social networks are crucial for the consumer side of the adoption process. Key findings and conclusions While for information diffusion predominantly the number of channels through which information can flow is important, and prevention of redundant information transfers helps to speed up information, the appreciation for the advantages of the innovation will require some redundancy and recurrent confirmation of the success of the innovation. To develop trust, even more confirmation is likely to be important and close social circles in which people repeatedly meet and know each other's acquaintances are known to be especially beneficial to create trust.},

  abstract = {A random walk is a basic stochastic process on graphs and a key primitive in the design of distributed algorithms. One of the most important features of random walks is that, under mild conditions, they converge to a stationary distribution in time that is at most polynomial in the size of the graph. This fundamental property, however, only holds if the graph does not change over time, while on the other hand many distributed networks are inherently dynamic, and their topology is subjected to potentially drastic changes. In this work we study the mixing (i.e., converging) properties of random walks on graphs subjected to random changes over time. Specifically, we consider the edge-Markovian random graph model: for each edge slot, there is a two-state Markov chain with transition probabilities \$p\$ (add a non-existing edge) and \$q\$ (remove an existing edge). We derive several positive and negative results that depend on both the density of the graph and the speed by which the graph changes. We show that if \$p\$ is very small (i.e., below the connectivity threshold of Erd\textbackslash H\{o\}s-R\textbackslash '\{e\}nyi random graphs), random walks do not mix (fast). When \$p\$ is larger, instead, we observe the following behavior: if the graph changes slowly over time (i.e., \$q\$ is small), random walks enjoy strong mixing properties that are comparable to the ones possessed by random walks on static graphs; however, if the graph changes too fast (i.e., \$q\$ is large), only coarse mixing properties are preserved.},

  abstract = {To understand how a complex system is organized and functions, researchers often identify communities in the system's network of interactions. Because it is practically impossible to explore all solutions to guarantee the best one, many community-detection algorithms rely on multiple stochastic searches. But for a given combination of network and stochastic algorithm, how many searches are sufficient to find a solution that is good enough? The standard approach is to pick a reasonably large number of searches and select the network partition with the highest quality or derive a consensus solution based on all network partitions. However, if different partitions have similar qualities such that the solution landscape is degenerate, the single best partition may miss relevant information, and a consensus solution may blur complementary communities. Here we address this degeneracy problem with coarse-grained descriptions of the solution landscape. We cluster network partitions based on their similarity and suggest an approach to determine the minimum number of searches required to describe the solution landscape adequately. To make good use of all partitions, we also propose different ways to explore the solution landscape, including a significance clustering procedure. We test these approaches on synthetic and real-world networks, and find that different networks and algorithms require a different number of searches and that exploring the coarse-grained solution landscape can reveal noteworthy complementary solutions and enable more reliable community detection.},

  abstract = {Among all tools used to understand collective human behaviour, few tools have been as successful as agent-based models (ABMs). These models have been particularly effective at describing emergent social behaviour, such as spatial segregation in neighbourhoods or opinion polarization on social networks. ABMs are particularly common in the study of opinion and belief dynamics, being used by fields ranging from anthropology to statistical physics. These models, much like the social systems they describe, often do not have unique output variables, scales, or clear order parameters. This lack of clearly measurable emergent behaviour makes such complex ABMs difficult to study, ultimately limiting their application to cases of empirical interest. In this paper, we introduce a series of approaches to analyze complex multidimensional ABMs, drawing from information theory and cluster analysis. We use these approaches to explore a multi-level agent-based model of ideological alignment introduced by Banisch and Olbrisch to extend M\"as and Flache's argument communication theory of bi-polarization. We use the tools introduced here to perform a thorough analysis of the model for small system sizes, identifying the convergence towards steady-state behaviour, and describing the full spectrum of steady-state distributions produced by this model. Finally, we show how the approach we introduced can be easily adapted for larger implementations, as well as for other complex agent-based models of social behaviour.},

This paper examines the role of government performance in shaping satisfaction with democracy in Australia, using Australian Election Study data from 1996 to 2019. The results demonstrate that frequent changes of prime minister, which a majority of voters disapproved of, and rising economic pessimism contributed to the decline of democratic satisfaction in Australia.},

Our result finds further justification acknowledging that both models provide maximum entropy distributions of binary time series with given means, auto-correlations, and lagged cross-correlations of order one.},

Using aggregated, cross-sectional survey data on political involvement from 34,241 respondents, we examine changes in the probability of ever having attended a protest or signed a petition over time periods and across cohorts using cross-classified, random-effects models. We find a strong generational effect on the probability of ever having attended a protest, which explains much of the observed change in self-reports of protest behavior. More than half of this generational effect is a result of compositional change, but we find little evidence that protest attendance diffused to new types of actors. We compare these findings with a less confrontational form of protesting, petition signing, which shows more period than cohort effects. We argue that social movement activities have not become a widespread means of civic engagement.},

In this regard, the role of user behavior in the formation of politically homogeneous environments (so-called echo chambers) is not fully understood. Building on the concept of selective exposure, we introduce the notion of selective political friending, i.e., the preference for political like-mindedness in social affiliations on social networking sites. In a pre-registered laboratory experiment (N = 199), we find that users preferably build connections to those who share opinions toward controversial political issues. Political like-mindedness outperforms advantages based on the popularity of another user or the career-related fit with another user. Political friending is particularly pronounced when individuals' pre-existing opinions are strong, while tendencies toward cognitive closure and the desire for shared reality do not impact like-minded friending. The present study unravels psychological patterns in the process of tie-building on SNS and points to the necessity to take motivational complexity into account when studying phenomena linked to political homogeneity. Being the first study to systematically address politically motivated contact choices on social networking sites jointly with their psychological antecedents, this study sheds new light on the debate about like-mindedness in online communication.},

  abstract = {Job satisfaction researchers typically assume a tripartite model, suggesting evaluations of the job are explained by latent cognitive and affective factors. However, in the attitudes literature, connectionist theorists view attitudes as emergent structures resulting from the mutually reinforcing causal force of interacting cognitive evaluations. Recently, the causal attitudes network (CAN; Dalege et al., 2016) model was proposed as an integration of both these perspectives with network theory. Here, we describe the CAN model and its implications for understanding job satisfaction. We extend the existing literature by drawing from both attitude and network theory. Using multiple data sets and measures of job satisfaction, we test these ideas empirically. First, drawing on the functional approach to attitudes, we show the instrumental-symbolic distinction in attitude objects is evident in job satisfaction networks. Specifically, networks for more instrumental features (e.g., pay) show stable, high connectivity and form a single cluster, whereas networks regarding symbolic features (e.g., supervisor) increase in connectivity with exposure (i.e., job tenure) and form clusters based on valence and cognitive-affective distinction. We show these distinctions result in ``small-world'' networks for symbolic features wherein affective reactions are more central than cognitive reactions, consistent with the affective primacy hypothesis. We show the practical advantage of CAN by demonstrating in longitudinal data that items with high centrality are more likely to affect change throughout the attitude network, and that network models are better able to predict future voluntary turnover compared with structural equation models. Implications of this exciting new model for research and practice are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

This update is more pronounced among voters exposed to negative news (negativity bias), first-time voters, and individuals who report a lower interest in politics. We do not find evidence of an average treatment effect on voting behaviour. However, we find that, when exposed to negative information, initially undecided voters are more likely to cast a blank vote, to abstain or to vote for opposition parties. Overall, our findings suggest that voters' sensitivity to information is heterogeneous and depends on the level of education and political awareness.},

The available observations often exhibit an intrinsic heterogeneity, which impacts on the network structure through the modification of specific pathways for distinct groups, such as disease subtypes. We propose to infer the resulting multiple graphs jointly in order to benefit from potential similarities across groups; on the other hand our modeling framework is able to accommodate group idiosyncrasies. We consider directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) as network structures, and develop a Bayesian method for structural learning of multiple DAGs. We explicitly account for Markov equivalence of DAGs, and propose a suitable prior on the collection of graph spaces that induces selective borrowing strength across groups. The resulting inference allows in particular to compute the posterior probability of edge inclusion, a useful summary for representing flow directions within the network. Finally, we detail a simulation study addressing the comparative performance of our method, and present an analysis of two protein networks together with a substantive interpretation of our findings.},

  abstract = {Sociophysics is a field that studies social behaviour using theories and techniques from topics such as statistical physics. In particular, it has become fashionable to use Monte Carlo simulations to explain and predict sociological phenomena. The Deffuant model is a popular mathematical model in sociophysics. Each individual holds an opinion in a certain real interval, and the opinion distribution of the population evolves with sequential random pairwise encounters. A pair of interacting individuals update their opinions towards a compromise if and only if their opinions differ by less than a given threshold called `confidence bound'. Incorporating network structure allows one to take into account heterogeneity of interactions in a population. We study the Deffuant model on networks by considering different network structures and interaction mechanisms between pairs of individuals. In particular, we show how convergence time and the number of opinion groups at equilibrium are affected by network topology, confidence bound, the number of participating agents, and their willingness to change their minds. We use numerical simulations to explore the opinion dynamics of the Deffuant model on networks and conduct regression analysis to model observed phenomena.

In such a network, the nodes represent the companies, and the links represent the ownership. Within this context, we introduce the out-degree of the nodes\textemdash which represents the diversification\textemdash and the in-degree of them\textemdash capturing the integration. Diversification and integration allow a clear description of the industrial structure that were formed by the considered companies. The stochastic dependence of diversification and integration is modeled through copulas. We argue that copulas are well suited for modelling the joint distribution. The analysis of the stochastic dependence between integration and diversification by means of the Tsallis entropy gives a crucial information on the reaction of the market structure to the external shocks\textemdash on the basis of some relevant cases of dependence between the considered variables. In this respect, the considered entropy framework provides insights on the relationship between in-degree and out-degree dependence structure and market polarisation or fairness. Moreover, the interpretation of the results in the light of the Tsallis entropy parameter gives relevant suggestions for policymakers who aim at shaping the industrial context for having high polarisation or fair joint distribution of diversification and integration. Furthermore, a discussion of possible parametrisations of the in-degree and out-degree marginal distribution\textemdash by means of power laws or exponential functions\textemdash{} is also carried out. An empirical experiment on a large dataset of Italian companies validates the theoretical framework.},

  abstract = {This paper deals with the fundamental issue of quantifying the degree of competitiveness underlying an election in a society. That is, given the vote shares of competing political parties in the election one needs to arrive at a representative metric of electoral competition. The vote share of a party represents its influence on the outcome of the election. A summary measure of differences of such influences across parties, aggregated in an unambiguous way, is an index of electoral competitiveness. The literature contains several such indices. Implicit under the choice of an index is a set of properties that the index satisfies. A highly attractive feature of the probability ratio index we suggest in this article, as a summary measure of electoral competition, is its suitability for making comparisons of competitiveness across elections with different number of parties. The probability ratio index is simply the ratio between the probabilities that the two voters drawn at random with (without) replacement have voted for different parties under actual vote shares across the competing parties and under equal vote shares across them. The comparability feature of the probability ratio index can be maintained without sacrificing any nice characteristic expected from an electoral competition measure. The probability ratio index is inversely related to the well-known Herfindahl\textendash Hirschman concentration index that indicates dominance of large parties, directly related to the fractionalization index, which indicates how vote shares are split among the parties, and also inversely related to the squared coefficient of variation, a highly popular measure of inequality. It is argued explicitly how the new index can be applied to measure competitiveness for true data. Simple examples are used to demonstrate why probability ratio index has a comparative advantage over some other well-known indices, particularly, in terms of cross-election comparability.},

No additional information is provided about the number of latent variables, nor of the relationship between the latent and observed variables. Is it possible to discover the number of latent components, and to learn a statistical model over the entire collection of variables? We address this question in the setting in which the latent and observed variables are jointly Gaussian, with the conditional statistics of the observed variables conditioned on the latent variables being specified by a graphical model. As a first step we give natural conditions under which such latent-variable Gaussian graphical models are identifiable given marginal statistics of only the observed variables. Essentially these conditions require that the conditional graphical model among the observed variables is sparse, while the effect of the latent variables is "spread out" over most of the observed variables. Next we propose a tractable convex program based on regularized maximum-likelihood for model selection in this latent-variable setting; the regularizer uses both the \$\textbackslash ell\_1\$ norm and the nuclear norm. Our modeling framework can be viewed as a combination of dimensionality reduction (to identify latent variables) and graphical modeling (to capture remaining statistical structure not attributable to the latent variables), and it consistently estimates both the number of latent components and the conditional graphical model structure among the observed variables. These results are applicable in the high-dimensional setting in which the number of latent/observed variables grows with the number of samples of the observed variables. The geometric properties of the algebraic varieties of sparse matrices and of low-rank matrices play an important role in our analysis.},

Ranging from model-based and optimization-based methods, existing efforts typically consider two sources of information, i.e. network structure and node attributes, to obtain communities with both denser network structure and similar attribute information. We argue that an inherent drawback of such methods is that, different impacts of different sources, is ignored during the clustering process. Besides, some existing community detection algorithms typically consider two sources of information but they cannot automatically determine the relative importance between them to reveal subspaces. As such, the detected communities may be unsatisfactory.In this work, we propose to integrate subspace into a new overlapping community detection framework, an Overlapping Community Detection with Subspaces on Double-Views (CDDV), which exploits the relative importance between structures and attributes. This leads to a better detection result, effectively injecting subspaces to show the diversity of communities into the detection process in an explicit manner. We conduct extensive experiments on four public benchmarks, demonstrating significant improvements over several state-of-the-art models. Further analysis verifies the importance of subspace finding for capturing better communities, justifying the rationality and effectiveness of CDDV.},

  abstract = {Here, an agent-based model is developed to forecast the outcome of a three-party election in a two-round voting system. The vote of each agent is determined from four variables related to economic indicators, quality of public services, ethical conduct of the current administration, and political profile of the voting population. In addition, each agent can be influenced by the opinion of the nearest neighbors. Numerical simulations are performed to investigate how these variables affect the elected candidate. The proposed model is also used to reproduce the presidential elections held in Brazil in 2010 and in Uruguay in 2019.},

  abstract = {Game of Life is a simple and elegant model to study dynamical system over networks. The model consists of a graph where every vertex has one of two types, namely, dead or alive. A configuration is a mapping of the vertices to the types. An update rule describes how the type of a vertex is updated given the types of its neighbors. In every round, all vertices are updated synchronously, which leads to a configuration update. While in general, Game of Life allows a broad range of update rules, we focus on two simple families of update rules, namely, underpopulation and overpopulation, that model several interesting dynamics studied in the literature. In both settings, a dead vertex requires at least a desired number of live neighbors to become alive. For underpopulation (resp., overpopulation), a live vertex requires at least (resp. at most) a desired number of live neighbors to remain alive. We study the basic computation problems, e.g., configuration reachability, for these two families of rules. For underpopulation rules, we show that these problems can be solved in polynomial time, whereas for overpopulation rules they are PSPACE-complete.},

Two particularly prominent models, the Ising model and Gaussian model, have largely developed in parallel using different (though often related) techniques, and several practical algorithms with rigorous sample complexity bounds have been established for each. In this paper, we adapt a recently proposed algorithm of Klivans and Meka (FOCS, 2017), based on the method of multiplicative weight updates, from the Ising model to the Gaussian model, via non-trivial modifications to both the algorithm and its analysis. The algorithm enjoys a sample complexity bound that is qualitatively similar to others in the literature, has a low runtime O(mp2) in the case of m samples and p nodes, and can trivially be implemented in an online manner.},

We find that Psychopathy and Narcissism are positively associated with political interest, but Narcissism is also negatively associated with political knowledge. In addition, both Psychopathy and Narcissism exert a direct, positive influence on participation. Our results imply that individuals exhibiting higher levels of Narcissism are not only less knowledgeable but also more interested in politics and more likely to participate when given the opportunity.},

We analyze the dataset with a Bayesian time-varying ideal point model showing the quick acceleration of more harsh policies across countries beginning in mid-March and continuing to the present. While some relatively low-cost policies like task forces and health monitoring began early, countries generally adopted more harsh measures within a narrow time window, suggesting strong policy diffusion effects.},

  abstract = {Non-Markovian dynamics pervades human activity and social networks and it induces memory effects and burstiness in a wide range of processes including inter-event time distributions, duration of interactions in temporal networks and human mobility. Here we propose a non-Markovian Majority-Vote model (NMMV) that introduces non-Markovian effects in the standard (Markovian) Majority-Vote model (SMV). The SMV model is one of the simplest two-state stochastic models for studying opinion dynamics, and displays a continuous order-disorder phase transition at a critical noise. In the NMMV model we assume that the probability that an agent changes state is not only dependent on the majority state of his neighbors but it also depends on his \{\textbackslash em age\}, i.e. how long the agent has been in his current state. The NMMV model has two regimes: the aging regime implies that the probability that an agent changes state is decreasing with his age, while in the anti-aging regime the probability that an agent changes state is increasing with his age. Interestingly, we find that the critical noise at which we observe the order-disorder phase transition is a non-monotonic function of the rate \$\textbackslash beta\$ of the aging (anti-aging) process. In particular the critical noise in the aging regime displays a maximum as a function of \$\textbackslash beta\$ while in the anti-aging regime displays a minimum. This implies that the aging/anti-aging dynamics can retard/anticipate the transition and that there is an optimal rate \$\textbackslash beta\$ for maximally perturbing the value of the critical noise. The analytical results obtained in the framework of the heterogeneous mean-field approach are validated by extensive numerical simulations on a large variety of network topologies.},

  abstract = {Symmetry is one of the important properties of Social networks to indicate the co-existence relationship between two persons, e.g., friendship or kinship. Centrality is an index to measure the importance of vertices/persons within a social network. Many kinds of centrality indices have been proposed to find prominent vertices, such as the eigenvector centrality and PageRank algorithm. PageRank-based algorithms are the most popular approaches to handle this task, since they are more suitable for directed networks, which are common situations in social media. However, the realistic problem in social networks is that the process to find true important persons is very complicated, since we should consider both how the influence of a vertex affects others and how many others follow a given vertex. However, past PageRank-based algorithms can only reflect the importance on the one side and ignore the influence on the other side. In addition, past algorithms only view the transition from one status to the next status as a linear process without considering more complicated situations. In this paper, we develop a novel centrality to find key persons within a social network by a proposed synthesized index which accounts for both the inflow and outflow matrices of a vertex. Besides, we propose different transition functions to represent the relationship from status to status. The empirical studies compare the proposed algorithms with the conventional algorithms and show the differences and flexibility of the proposed algorithm.},

In most public opinion dynamics models, people only consider that individuals update their opinions through interactions with other individuals. This represents the field-dependent cognitive style of the individual. The field-independent cognitive style is ignored in such cases. We consider both cognitive styles in public opinion dynamics and propose a public opinion evolution model based on cognitive styles (CS model). The opinions of neighbors and experiences of the individual represent field-dependent cognition and field-independent cognition, respectively, and the individual combines both cognitive styles to update his/her own opinion. In the proposed model, the experience parameter is designed to represent the weight of the current opinion in terms of the individual's experiences and the cognitive parameter is proposed to represent the tendencies of his/her cognitive styles. We experimentally verify that the CS and Hegselmann\textendash Krause (HK) models are similar in terms of public opinion evolution trends; with an increase in radius of confidence, the steady state of a social system shifts from divergence to polarization and eventually reaches consensus. Considering that individuals from different cultures have different degrees of inclination for the two styles, we present experiments focusing on cognitive parameter and experience parameter and analyze the evolutionary trends of opinion dynamics in different styles. We find that when an individual has a greater tendency toward the field-independent cognitive style under the influence of culture, the time required for a social system to reach a steady state will increase; the system will have greater difficultly in reaching consensus, mirroring the evolutionary trends in public opinion in the context of eastern and western cultures. The CS model constitutes an opinion dynamics model that is more consistent with the real world and may also serve as a basis for future cross-cultural research.},

In study 2, participants were randomly assigned to belief, neutral, or disbelief conditions to accept a priming task and then completed a prosocial tendencies measure. We further designed study 3 to replicate the results. The results of study 1 showed a strong positive correlation between belief and prosocial tendencies. The results of study 2 demonstrated that belief promotes prosocial tendencies, while disbelief priming yields no effect. And these results were confirmed by study 3. In conclusion, belief was positively correlated with prosocial tendencies. A further study found that belief significantly predicted prosocial tendencies only under the low-inspiration condition, and the moderating role of inspiration was also verified.

Most of the existing methods consider trust in a person as a value which does not vary across different scenarios without any attention to the distinction of domains or communities where trust is derived. However, the notion of context is a significant and indispensable factor for trust evaluation in practice. Due to the lack of the consideration of context, traditional methods cannot resolve the issue that arises when a highly trustworthy person in one domain is likely to dominate the results of trust assessment in others where the person is in fact less authoritative. To solve this problem, in this paper, we develop a general approach to accomplish topic-sensitive trust evaluation by considering the context of trust. We first propose a general framework which presents the well-organized architecture of topic-sensitive trust evaluation in online communities. Then, a user-topic model is proposed to automatically extract topic data from user-generated content based on the Labeled Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LLDA) model. To compare the topic differences between users, we design a topic coverage function for revealing their trust relationships in diverse topics. Moreover, we employ two traditional methods and extend them to accomplish trust prediction for people with multiple domain knowledge. Experiments based on a real-world dataset show that extended topic-sensitive approaches are more adaptive and accurate than those topic-free trust evaluation approaches, especially when the trust application scenario features multiple topics.},

Even though community authorities continuously prompt their users to follow the regulations, it is observed that hate speech and abusive language usage are on the rise. In this paper, we quantify and analyze the patterns of violations of normative behaviour among the users of Stack Overflow (SO) - a well-known technical question-answer site for professionals and enthusiast programmers, while posting a comment. Even though the site has been dedicated to technical problem solving and debugging, hate speech as well as posting offensive comments make the community "toxic". By identifying and minimising various patterns of norm violations in different SO communities, the community would become less toxic and thereby the community can engage more effectively in its goal of knowledge sharing. Moreover, through automatic detection of such comments, the authors can be warned by the moderators, so that it is less likely to be repeated, thereby the reputation of the site and community can be improved. Based on the comments extracted from two different data sources on SO, this work first presents a taxonomy of norms that are violated. Second, it demonstrates the sanctions for certain norm violations. Third, it proposes a recommendation system that can be used to warn users that they are about to violate a norm. This can help achieve norm adherence in online communities.},

The size of the lobby \$q\$ (i.e., the pressure group) is a crucial parameter that changes the behavior of the system. The \$q\$-voter model has been applied on multiplex networks in a previous work [Phys. Rev E. 92. 052812. (2015)], and it has been shown that the character of the phase transition depends on the number of levels in the multiplex network as well as the value of \$q\$. Here we study phase transition character in the case when on each level of the network the lobby size is different, resulting in two parameters \$q\_1\$ and \$q\_2\$. We find evidence of successive phase transitions when a continuous phase transition is followed by a discontinuous one or two consecutive discontinuous phases appear, depending on the parameter. When analyzing this system, we even encounter mixed-order (or hybrid) phase transition. We perform simulations and obtain supporting analytical solutions on a simple multiplex case - a duplex clique, which consists of two fully overlapped complete graphs (cliques).},

  abstract = {Decades of social science research identified ten fundamental dimensions that provide the conceptual building blocks to describe the nature of human relationships. Yet, it is not clear to what extent these concepts are expressed in everyday language and what role they have in shaping observable dynamics of social interactions. After annotating conversational text through crowdsourcing, we trained NLP tools to detect the presence of these types of interaction from conversations, and applied them to 160M messages written by geo-referenced Reddit users, 290k emails from the Enron corpus and 300k lines of dialogue from movie scripts. We show that social dimensions can be predicted purely from conversations with an AUC up to 0.98, and that the combination of the predicted dimensions suggests both the types of relationships people entertain (conflict vs. support) and the types of real-world communities (wealthy vs. deprived) they shape.},

  abstract = {Variational Graph Autoencoder (VGAE) has recently gained traction for learning representations on graphs. Its inception has allowed models to achieve state-of-the-art performance for challenging tasks such as link prediction, rating prediction, and node clustering. However, a fundamental flaw exists in Variational Autoencoder (VAE)-based approaches. Specifically, merely minimizing the loss of VAE increases the deviation from its primary objective. Focusing on Variational Graph Autoencoder for Community Detection (VGAECD) we found that optimizing the loss using the stochastic gradient descent often leads to sub-optimal community structure especially when initialized poorly. We address this shortcoming by introducing a dual optimization procedure. This procedure aims to guide the optimization process and encourage learning of the primary objective. Additionally, we linearize the encoder to reduce the number of learning parameters. The outcome is a robust algorithm that outperforms its predecessor.},

  abstract = {Modeling and inference with multivariate sequences is central in a number of signal processing applications such as acoustics, social network analysis, biomedical, and finance, to name a few. The linear-Gaussian state-space model is a common way to describe a time series through the evolution of a hidden state, with the advantage of presenting a simple inference procedure due to the celebrated Kalman filter. A fundamental question when analyzing multivariate sequences is the search for relationships between their entries (or the modeled hidden states), especially when the inherent structure is a non-fully connected graph. In such context, graphical modeling combined with parsimony constraints allows to limit the proliferation of parameters and enables a compact data representation which is easier to interpret by the experts. In this work, we propose a novel expectation-minimization algorithm for estimating the linear matrix operator in the state equation of a linear-Gaussian state-space model. Lasso regularization is included in the M-step, that we solved using a proximal splitting Douglas-Rachford algorithm. Numerical experiments illustrate the benefits of the proposed model and inference technique, named GraphEM, over competitors relying on Granger causality.},

  abstract = {Estimating the number of factors in multivariate data is at the crux of psychological measurement. Factor analysis has a long tradition in the field but it's been challenged recently by exploratory graph analysis (EGA), an approach based on network psychometrics. EGA first estimates a regularized partial correlation network using the graphical least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (GLASSO), and then applies the Walktrap community detection algorithm, which identifies communities (or factors) in the network. Simulation studies have demonstrated that EGA has comparable or better accuracy than contemporary state-of-the-art factor analytic methods (e.g., parallel analysis), while providing some additional advantages such as not requiring rotations and deterministic allocation of items into factors. Despite EGA's effectiveness, there has yet to be an investigation into whether other community detection algorithms could achieve equivalent or better perfomance. In the present study, we performed a Monte Carlo simulation using the GLASSO and two variants of a non-regularized partial correlation network estimation method and several community detection algorithms in the open-source igraph package in R. The purpose of the present study was to critically examine whether the network estimation and community detection components of EGA are optimal for estimating factors in psychological data as well as to provide a systematic investigation into how different community detection algorithms perform ``out-of-the-box.'' The results indicate that the Fast-greedy, Louvain, and Walktrap algorithms paired with the GLASSO method were consistently among the most accurate and least biased across conditions.},

Past research has applied traditional methods, such as factor analysis, to uncovering common dimensions of schizotypy. In the present study, we aimed to advance the construct of schizotypy, measured by the Wisconsin Schizotypy Scales\textendash Short Forms (WSS-SF), beyond this general scope by applying two different psychometric network filtering approaches\textemdash the state-of-the-art approach (lasso), which has been employed in previous studies, and an alternative approach (information-filtering networks; IFNs). First, we applied both filtering approaches to two large, independent samples of WSS-SF data (ns = 5,831 and 2,171) and assessed each approach's representation of the WSS-SF's schizotypy construct. Both filtering approaches produced results similar to those from traditional methods, with the IFN approach producing results more consistent with previous theoretical interpretations of schizotypy. Then we evaluated how well both filtering approaches reproduced the global and local network characteristics of the two samples. We found that the IFN approach produced more consistent results for both global and local network characteristics. Finally, we sought to evaluate the predictability of the network centrality measures for each filtering approach, by determining the core, intermediate, and peripheral items on the WSS-SF and using them to predict interview reports of schizophrenia-spectrum symptoms. We found some similarities and differences in their effectiveness, with the IFN approach's network structure providing better overall predictive distinctions. We discuss the implications of our findings for schizotypy and for psychometric network analysis more generally.},

  abstract = {Nearly all personality measurement and assessment has been shaped by traditional psychometric methods such as classical test theory. Despite advances in personality theory and psychometrics, most personality assessment instruments were developed using traditional psychometric concepts and measures. In recent years, a new field of network psychometrics has emerged, which embraces the inherent complexity of personality and promises to change the way researchers think about psychological constructs. With this new tool comes the opportunity to refine and advance measurement and assessment practices, particularly in personality research. In this paper, we briefly review modern personality theories and discuss how psychometric network models can inform their conjectures. After, we review trends in personality measurement and show how psychometric networks complement these movements. Then, we put forward a psychometric network framework for developing personality assessment instruments. Within this framework, we connect network measures to traditional psychometric measures and provide guidelines for how psychometric networks can be used to develop personality scales. We argue that psychometric networks allow better control over the construct being measured, providing greater specificity in the assessment of psychological attributes. Several future directions emphasizing the development and improvement of this framework are provided.},

From this review, we formalize a framework for assessing the evidence for the validity of questionnaires from the psychometric network perspective. We focus specifically on the structural phase of validation, where items are assessed for redundancy, dimensionality, and internal structure. In this discussion, we underline the importance of identifying unique personality components (i.e. an item or set of items that share a unique common cause) and representing the breadth of each trait's domain in personality networks. After, we argue that psychometric network models have measures that are statistically equivalent to factor models but we suggest that their substantive interpretations differ. Finally, we provide a novel measure of structural consistency, which provides complementary information to internal consistency measures.

In the last decade, this topic has received renewed interested with the introduction of psychometric network models. In psychology, these models are often contrasted with latent variable (e.g., factor) models. Recent research has shown that differences between the two tend to be more substantive than statistical. One recently developed algorithm called the Loadings Comparison Test (LCT) was developed to predict whether data were generated from a random, factor, or network model. A significant limitation of current LCT implementation is that it's based on heuristics that were derived from descriptive statistics. In the present study, we used artificial neural networks to replace these heuristics, and develop a more robust and generalizable algorithm. We performed a simulation study that compared neural networks to the original LCT algorithm as well as logistic regression models that were trained on the same data. We found that the neural networks performed as well as or better than both methods, demonstrating generalizablity across data generating models. We echo the call for more formal theories about the relations between variables and discuss the role of the LCT in this process.},

Using a Monte Carlo simulation approach, we evaluate the accuracy of network, CFA, and exploratory factor analysis (EFA) loadings to estimate the population loading matrix. Our results demonstrate that the network loadings can effectively estimate the population factor loadings and are more similar to EFA loadings than CFA loadings. This suggests that network loadings can provide similar information as factor loadings and therefore can be used in a similar way. Specifically, network loadings can be used as an item selection criterion. Moreover, they open avenues to performing measurement invariance analyses and computing network scores (or the network equivalent of factor scores).},

Despite being an effective strategy for ensuring high internal consistency, the information in tests may become redundant or worse confound the interpretation of the test scores. With the advent of network models, where tests represent a complex system and components (usually items) represent causally autonomous features, redundant variables may have inadvertent effects on the interpretation of their metrics. These issues motivated the development of a novel approach called Unique Variable Analysis (UVA), which detects redundant variables in multivariate data. The goal of UVA is to statistically identify potential redundancies in multivariate data so that researchers can make decisions about how best to handle them. Using a Monte Carlo simulation approach, we generated multivariate data with redundancies that were based on examples of known real-world redundancies. We then demonstrate the effects that redundancy can have on the accurate estimation of dimensions. Next, we evaluated UVA's ability to detect redundant variables in the simulated data. Based on these results, we provide a tutorial for how to apply UVA to real-world data. Our example data demonstrate that redundant variables create inaccurate estimates of dimensional structure but after applying UVA, the expected structure can be recovered. In sum, our study suggests that redundancy can have substantial effects on validity if left unchecked and that redundancy assessment should be integrated into standard validation practices.},

The resulting dynamics in our model is substantially different from that in classic bounded confidence model. We find that: (1) in acceptance case, the opinions of all agents can always reach a consensus in bounded time; (2)in compliance case, both consensus and strong diversity of expressed opinions can be observed.

However, there has been little formal investigation of causation in this framework, despite causal models being a fundamental part of science and explanation. Here we introduce causal geometry, which formalizes not only how outcomes are impacted by parameters, but also how the parameters of a model can be intervened upon. Therefore we introduce a geometric version of "effective information"---a known measure of the informativeness of a causal relationship. We show that it is given by the matching between the space of effects and the space of interventions, in the form of their geometric congruence. Therefore, given a fixed intervention capability, an effective causal model is one that matches those interventions. This is a consequence of "causal emergence," wherein macroscopic causal relationships may carry more information than "fundamental" microscopic ones. We thus argue that a coarse-grained model may, paradoxically, be more informative than the microscopic one, especially when it better matches the scale of accessible interventions---as we illustrate on toy examples.},

Methods Using an Internet panel survey conducted by the Making Electoral Democracy Work project covering the 2013 state, 2013 federal, and 2014 European elections in Bavaria (Germany), our probit models examine mediation and moderation effects of three election-related characteristics: the issues that citizens consider most central in the elections, citizens' interest in the elections, and the perceived influence among citizens of the policies of the different levels of policy making on their well-being. Results The results indicate an overall gender difference in turnout in Bavaria with women being less likely to vote compared with men. Yet, this gender effect ceases to be significant once citizens' attitudes toward and perceptions of specific elections are controlled for. Interest in the election at hand has a particularly strong and positive effect on the likelihood of voting. We find no significant gender interactions. Conclusion Citizens' interest in and perceptions of specific elections have a strong impact on turnout and gender differences therein.},

  abstract = {In the last three decades several countries around the word have transferred authority from their national to their regional governments. However, not all their regions have been empowered in the same magnitude and important differences can be observed between and within countries. Why do some regions obtain more power than others? Current literature argues that variation in the redistribution of power and resources between regions is introduced by demand. Yet, these explanations are conditioned on the presence of strong regionalist parties or territorial cleavages. This article instead proposes a theory that links the government's risk of future electoral defeat with heterogeneous decentralisation, and tests its effects using data from 15 European countries and 141 regions. The results provide evidence that parties in government protect themselves against the risk of electoral defeat by selectively targeting decentralisation towards regions in which they are politically strong. The findings challenge previous research that overestimate the importance of regionalist parties while overlooking differences between regions.},

Moreover, I illustrate that common strategies for dealing with collinearity only sidestep the perceived problem by biasing 5 the parameters, reformulating the model in such a way that it maps onto different research questions, or both. I conclude that collinearity in itself is not a problem and that researchers should be aware of what their approaches for addressing it actually achieve.},

In some situations the output of RFCI is slightly less informative, in particular with respect to conditional independence information. However, we prove that any causal information in the output of RFCI is correct in the asymptotic limit. We also define a class of graphs on which the outputs of FCI and RFCI are identical. We prove consistency of FCI and RFCI in sparse high-dimensional settings, and demonstrate in simulations that the estimation performances of the algorithms are very similar.

In the classical Bounded Confidence Model, agents opinions get attracted when they are close enough. The proposed model extends this by adding a repulsion component, which models the effect of opinions getting further pushed away when dissimilar enough. With this repulsion component added, and under a repulsion-attraction cleavage assumption, it is shown that a new stable configuration emerges beyond the classical consensus configuration, namely the polarization configuration. More specifically, it is shown that total consensus and total polarization are the only two possible limiting configurations. The paper further provides an analysis of the infinite population regime in dimension 1 and higher, with a phase transition phenomenon conjectured and backed heuristically.},

The evidence base from previous large-N studies is surprisingly thin, but our extensive data enable us to move beyond the problematic cross-country correlations used in previous studies. Hence, we conduct tests that control for country-specific characteristics while ensuring sufficient variation on the slow-moving bureaucracy variables to enable precise estimation. Our analysis suggests that previous cross-country regressions have vastly overstated the strength of the relationship. While this casts uncertainty on the proposition that there is an effect of Weberian bureaucracy on growth, our further analysis suggests that\textemdash if an effect exists\textemdash it may operate in the short term and be stronger in recent decades.},

You can use such an understanding as the starting point of your own career in the field of network science. This has been, so far, an interdisciplinary endeavor.

There are hundreds of different algorithms to solve the community detection task, each with its own understanding and definition of what a "community" is. Dozens of review works attempt to order such a diverse landscape -- classifying community discovery algorithms by the process they employ to detect communities, by their explicitly stated definition of community, or by their performance on a standardized task. In this paper, we classify community discovery algorithms according to a fourth criterion: the similarity of their results. We create an Algorithm Similarity Network (ASN), whose nodes are the community detection approaches, connected if they return similar groupings. We then perform community detection on this network, grouping algorithms that consistently return the same partitions or overlapping coverage over a span of more than one thousand synthetic and real world networks. This paper is an attempt to create a similarity-based classification of community detection algorithms based on empirical data. It improves over the state of the art by comparing more than seventy approaches, discovering that the ASN contains well-separated groups, making it a sensible tool for practitioners, aiding their choice of algorithms fitting their analytic needs.},

However, the relative importance of these characteristics, and in some cases the direction of their relationships with trust, has varied across studies. In this paper, we posit a contingency model of trust, suggesting that the effects of the above variables on trust are moderated by length of the customer/service provider relationship.

  abstract = {The concept of electoral competition plays a central role in many subfields of political science, but no consensus exists on how to measure it. One key challenge is how to conceptualize and measure electoral competitiveness at the district level across alternative electoral systems. Recent efforts to meet this challenge have introduced general measures of competitiveness which rest on explicit calculations about how votes translate into seats, but also implicit assumptions about how effort maps into votes (and how costly effort is). We investigate how assumptions about the effort-to-votes mapping affect the units in which competitiveness is best measured, arguing in favor of vote-share-denominated measures and against vote-share-per-seat measures. Whether elections under multimember proportional representation systems are judged more or less competitive than single-member plurality or runoff elections depends directly on the units in which competitiveness is assessed (and hence on assumptions about how effort maps into votes).},

  abstract = {Most research on issue ownership examines the topic as an independent variable that may shape campaign strategy or voter behavior. In contrast, our study looks at ownership as a dependent variable. Specifically, we employ a national Internet survey of registered U.S. voters to gauge the extent to which such judgments are influenced by individual-level factors other than partisan identity. We find that while partisanship shapes ownership beliefs to a considerable degree, policy preferences and performance evaluations have significant effects across a range of valence and position issues. While feelings of ambivalence toward the in- or out-party do not have a consistent effect on ownership beliefs, higher out-party ambivalence reduces the probability that citizens will identify their own party as owning most issues. It is therefore premature, and probably incorrect, to assume that perceived ownership is little more than an expression of a person's partisan attachment or intended vote.

This conclusion is limited by the limited number and types of groups studied. When researchers use a more heterogeneous array of targets, people across the political spectrum express prejudice against groups with dissimilar values and beliefs. Evidence for this worldview conflict perspective emerges in both politics and religion, as well as individual differences such as Openness, disgust sensitivity and cognitive ability. Although these two perspectives differ substantially, there is some identifiable common ground between them, particularly the assumption of some psychological differences between liberals and conservatives. We discuss some remaining open questions related to worldview conflict reduction, causal processes, the robustness of the assumptions of the traditional perspective, and differences between political elites and the public.},

We find mixed support for the OMC bias attenuation hypothesis: whereas OMC is associated with avoiding selective exposure to political information, it did not attenuate political biases across seven separate tests.

This notion has been adapted to temporal graphs (that is, graphs in which edges can appear and disappear during time) and in this paper we address the question of finding the top-k nodes for this metric. Computing the temporal closeness for one node can be done in O(m) time, where m is the number of temporal edges. Therefore computing exactly the closeness for all nodes, in order to find the ones with top closeness, would require O(nm) time, where n is the number of nodes. This time complexity is intractable for large temporal graphs. Instead, we show how this measure can be efficiently approximated by using a ``backward'' temporal breadth-first search algorithm and a classical sampling technique. Our experimental results show that the approximation is excellent for nodes with high closeness, allowing us to detect them in practice in a fraction of the time needed for computing the exact closeness of all nodes. We validate our approach with an extensive set of experiments.},

  abstract = {On the morning of November 9th 2016, the world woke up to the shocking outcome of the US Presidential elections: Donald Trump was the 45th President of the United States of America. An unexpected event that still has tremendous consequences all over the world. Today, we know that a minority of social bots, automated social media accounts mimicking humans, played a central role in spreading divisive messages and disinformation, possibly contributing to Trump's victory. In the aftermath of the 2016 US elections, the world started to realize the gravity of widespread deception in social media. Following Trump's exploit, we witnessed to the emergence of a strident dissonance between the multitude of efforts for detecting and removing bots, and the increasing effects that these malicious actors seem to have on our societies. This paradox opens a burning question: What strategies should we enforce in order to stop this social bot pandemic? In these times, during the run-up to the 2020 US elections, the question appears as more crucial than ever. What stroke social, political and economic analysts after 2016, deception and automation, has been however a matter of study for computer scientists since at least 2010. In this work, we briefly survey the first decade of research in social bot detection. Via a longitudinal analysis, we discuss the main trends of research in the fight against bots, the major results that were achieved, and the factors that make this never-ending battle so challenging. Capitalizing on lessons learned from our extensive analysis, we suggest possible innovations that could give us the upper hand against deception and manipulation. Studying a decade of endeavours at social bot detection can also inform strategies for detecting and mitigating the effects of other, more recent, forms of online deception, such as strategic information operations and political trolls.},

One of these states is composed only by Susceptible individuals S, with no drinkers (\$M=R=0\$). On the other hand, the other absorbing state is composed only by Risk drinkers R (\$S=M=0\$).

Relying foremost on an analysis of the number of days to school closure after the day of the 10th confirmed case of COVID-19 in 134 countries, the paper finds that other things being equal, democratic countries tended to implement school closures more quickly than those with a more authoritarian regime, while countries with higher government effectiveness tended to take longer than those with less effective state apparatuses. Similar, yet\textemdash with respect to democracy\textemdash less substantial results are retrieved in a supplementary analysis of 158 countries, where the starting point is instead the day of China's first COVID-19 related school closure.

  abstract = {Is morality a combinatorial system in which a small number of simple moral `elements' combine to form a large number of complex moral `molecules'? According to the theory of morality-as-cooperation, morality is a collection of biological and cultural solutions to the problems of cooperation recurrent in human social life. As evolutionary game theory has shown, there are many types of cooperation; hence, the theory explains many types of morality, including: family values, group loyalty, reciprocity, heroism, deference, fairness and property rights. As with any set of discrete items, these seven `elements' can, in principle, be combined in multiple ways. But are they in practice? In this paper, we show that they are. For each combination of two elements, we hypothesise candidate moral molecules; and we successfully locate examples of them in the professional and popular literature. These molecules include: fraternity, blood revenge, family pride, filial piety, gavelkind, primogeniture, friendship, patriotism, tribute, diplomacy, common ownership, honour, confession, turn taking, restitution, modesty, mercy, munificence, arbitration, mendicancy, and queuing. Thus morality \textendash{} like many other physical, biological, psychological and cultural systems \textendash{} is indeed a combinatorial system. And morality-as-cooperation provides a principled and systematic taxonomy that has the potential to explain all moral ideas, possible and actual. Pursuing the many implications of this theory will help to place the study of morality on a more secure scientific footing.},

After underscoring the benefits of exploring religious identification using cross-national data, we employ an original data set composed of nationally representative surveys in three European countries to model religious identification in two ways: importance (independent strength of attachment) and prominence (prioritization of one's religious identity relative to the others one holds). We document substantial variation in the degree to which individuals define themselves on the basis of their religious identity. We then test predictions drawn from existing theories to model these two measures. Our results extend current understandings of what shapes psychological attachment to religion and raise new questions for future theorization and analysis.},

Being able to detect highly linked communities in a network can lead to many benefits, such as understanding relationships between entities or interactions between biological genes, for instance. Two different immunological algorithms have been designed for this problem, called OPT-IA and HYBRID-IA, respectively. The main difference between the two algorithms is the search strategy and related immunological operators developed: the first carries out a random search together with purely stochastic operators; the last one is instead based on a deterministic Local Search that tries to refine and improve the current solutions discovered. The robustness of OPT-IA and HYBRID-IA has been assessed on several real social networks. These same networks have also been considered for comparing both algorithms with other seven different metaheuristics and the well-known greedy optimization LOUVAIN algorithm. The experimental analysis conducted proves that OPT-IA and HYBRID-IA are reliable optimization methods for community detection, outperforming all compared algorithms.},

  abstract = {From the outset, computational sociologists have stressed leveraging multiple relations when blockmodeling social networks. Despite this emphasis, the majority of published research over the past 40?years has focused on solving blockmodels for a single relation. When multiple relations exist, a reductionist approach is often employed, where the relations are stacked or aggregated into a single matrix, allowing the researcher to apply single relation, often heuristic, blockmodeling techniques. Accordingly, in this article, we develop an exact procedure for the exploratory blockmodeling of multiple relation, mixed-mode networks. In particular, given (a) N1 actors, (b) N2 events, (c) an (N1?N1) binary one-mode network depicting the ties between actors, and (d) an (N1?N2) binary two-mode network representing the ties between actors and events, we use integer programming to find globally optimal (P1?P1|P1?P2) image matrices and partitions, where P1 and P2 represent the number of actor and event positions, respectively. Given the problem?s computational complexity, we also develop an algorithm to generate a minimal set of non-isomorphic image matrices, as well as a complementary, easily accessible heuristic using the network analysis software Pajek. We illustrate these concepts using a simple, hypothetical example, and we apply our techniques to a terrorist network.},

Recently, psychologists have begun to conceptualize mental disorders such as depression as an alternative stable state, and suggested that early warning signals based on the phenomenon of critical slowing down might be useful for predicting sudden transitions into depression or other psychiatric disorders. Harnessing the potential of early warning signals requires us to understand their limitations as well as the factors influencing their performance in practice. In this paper, we (a) review limitations of early warning signals based on critical slowing down to better understand when they can and cannot occur, and (b) study the conditions under which early warning signals may anticipate critical transitions in online-monitoring settings by simulating from a bistable dynamical system, varying crucial features such as sampling frequency, noise intensity, and speed of approaching the tipping point. We find that, in sharp contrast to their reputation of being generic or model-agnostic, whether early warning signals occur or not strongly depends on the specifics of the system. We also find that they are very sensitive to noise, potentially limiting their utility in practical applications. We discuss the implications of our findings and provide suggestions and recommendations for future research.},

  abstract = {Testing the (in)equality of variances is an important problem in many statistical applications. We develop default Bayes factor tests to assess the (in)equality of two or more population variances, as well as a test for whether the population variance equals a specific value. The resulting test can be used to check assumptions for commonly used procedures such as the t-test or ANOVA, or test substantive hypotheses concerning variances directly. We further extend the Bayes factor to allow H0 to have a null-region. Researchers may have directed hypotheses such as {$\sigma$}12 {$>$} {$\sigma$}22, or want to combine hypotheses about equality with hypotheses about inequality, for example {$\sigma$}12 = {$\sigma$}22 {$>$} ({$\sigma$}32, {$\sigma$}42). We generalize our Bayes factor to accommodate such hypotheses for K {$>$} 2 groups. We show that our Bayes factor fulfills a number of desiderata, provide practical examples illustrating the method, and compare it to a recently proposed fractional Bayes factor procedure by B\textasciidieresis oing-Messing and Mulder (2018). Our procedure is implemented in the R package bfvartest.},

  abstract = {Differential equations are a powerful tool for modeling how systems change over time, but they can be a little hard to get into. Love, on the other hand, is humanity's perennial topic; some even claim it is all you need. In this blog post \textemdash{} inspired by Strogatz (1988, 2015) \textemdash{} I will introduce linear differential equations as a means to study the types of love affairs two people might find themselves in. Do opposites attract? What happens to a relationship if lovers are out of touch with their own feelings? We will answer these and other questions using two coupled linear differential equations. On our journey, we will use graphical as well as mathematical methods to classify the types of relationships this modeling framework can accommodate. In a follow-up blog post, we will also play around with non-linear terms and add a third wheel to the mix, which can lead to chaos \textemdash{} in the technical sense of the term, of course. Excited? Then let's get started! Introducing Romeo A lovestruck Romeo sang the streets of serenade Laying everybody low with a love song that he made Finds a streetlight, steps out of the shade Says something like, "You and me, babe, how about it?" Romeo is quite the emotional type. Let \$R(t)\$ denote his feelings at time point \$t\$. Following common practice, we will usually write \$R\$ instead of \$R(t)\$, making the time dependence implicit. The process which describes how Romeo's feelings change is rather simple: it depends only on Romeo's current feelings. We write: which is a linear differential equation. Note that this implicitly encodes how Romeo's feelings change over time, since when we know \$R\$ at time point \$t\$, we can compute the direction and speed with which \$R\$ will change \textemdash{} the derivative denotes velocity. Our goal, however, is to find an explicit, closed-form expression for Romeo's feelings at time point \$t\$. In this particular case, we can do this analytically: A differential equation describes how something changes; to kickstart the process, we need an initial condition \$R\_0\$. This allows us to find the constant of integration \$C\$. In particular, assume that \$R = R\_0\$ at \$t = 0\$, which leads to: such that: The left two panels of the figure below visualize how Romeo's feelings change over time for \$a {$>$} 0\$ with initial condition \$R\_0 = 1\$ (top) or \$R\_0 = -1\$ (bottom). The right two panels show how his feelings change for \$a {$<$} 0\$ with \$R\_0 = 100\$ (top) or \$R\_0 = -100\$ (bottom). We conclude: Romeo is a simple guy, albeit with an emotion regulation problem. When the object of his affection is such that \$a {$>$} 0\$, his feelings will either grow exponentially towards mad love if he starts out with a positive first impression (\$R\_0 {$>$} 0\$), or grow exponentially towards mad hatred if he starts out with a negative first impression (\$R\_0 {$<$} 0\$). On the other hand, if \$a {$<$} 0\$, then regardless of his initial feelings, they will decay exponentially towards indifference. For \$R\_0 = 0\$, Romeo's feelings never change. For any other initial condition, we have uhindered, exponential growth when \$a {$>$} 0\$; it never stops. For any other initial condition and \$a {$<$} 0\$, we crash down to zero very rapidly. Thus \$R = 0\$ is a fixed point in both cases, which is stable for \$a {$<$} 0\$ but becomes unstable if \$a {$>$} 0\$. We can visualize this in phase space on a line. The phase space is filled with all possible trajectories because each point can serve as the initial condition. In the next section, a wonderful new episode in Romeo's life begins: he meets Juliet. Introducing Juliet Juliet says, "Hey, it's Romeo, you nearly gave me a heart attack" He's underneath the window, she's singing, "Hey, la, my boyfriend's back You shouldn't come around here singing up at people like that Anyway, what you gonna do about it?" Life becomes more complicated for Romeo now that Juliet is in his life. It is their first real relationship, and they have much to learn. We start simple. Let \$J\$ denote Juliet's feelings for Romeo, and let \$R\$ denote Romeo's feelings for Juliet. We can extend our single linear differential equation from above to a system of two linear differential equations: Using the results from above, the solutions to the two differential equations are: where \$R(t)\$ and \$J(t)\$ give the trajectories of love for Romeo and Juliet, respectively, and \$J\_0\$ is Juliet's initial feeling towards Romeo at \$t = 0\$. In contrast to the one-dimensional phase diagram from above, we now have a two-dimensional picture which is known as a vector field.},

  doi = {10.31234/osf.io/nue4z},
  abstract = {Network models have become a valuable tool in making sense of a diverse range of social, biological, and information systems. These models marry graph and probability theory to visualize, understand, and interpret variables and their relations as nodes and edges in a graph. Many applications of network models rely on undirected graphs in which the absence of an edge between two nodes encodes conditional independence between the corresponding variables. To gauge the importance of nodes in such a network, various node centrality measures have become widely used, especially in psychology and neuroscience. It is intuitive to interpret nodes with high centrality measures as being important in a causal sense. Here, using the causal framework based on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), we show that the relation between causal influence and node centrality measures is not straightforward. In particular, the correlation between causal influence and several node centrality measures is weak, except for eigenvector centrality. Our results provide a cautionary tale: if the underlying real-world system can be modeled as a DAG, but researchers interpret nodes with high centrality as causally important, then this may result in sub-optimal interventions.}

  abstract = {``Contentious politics'' has become the main label to define a wide range of previously separated fields of research encompassing topics such as collective action, radicalization, armed insurgencies, and terrorism. Over the past two decades, scholars have tried to bring these various strands together into a unified field of study. In so doing, they have developed a methodology to isolate and analyze the common social and cognitive mechanisms underlying several diverse historical phenomena such as ``insurgencies,'' ``revolutions,'' ``radicalization,'' or ``terrorism.'' A multidisciplinary approach was adopted open to contributions from diverse fields such as economics, sociology, and psychology. The aim of this paper is to add to the multidisciplinarity of the field of Contentious Politics (CP) and introduce the instruments of Agent-Based Modeling and network game-theory to the study of some fundamental mechanisms analyzed within this literature. In particular, the model presented in this paper describes the dynamics of one process, here defined as ``the radicalization of politics,'' and its main underlying mechanisms. Their mechanics are analyzed in diverse social contexts differentiated by the values of four parameters: the extent of repression, inequality, social tolerance, and interconnectivity. The model can be used to explain the basic dynamics underlying different phenomena such as the development of radicalization, populism, and popular rebellions. In the final part, different societies characterized by diverse values of the aforementioned four parameters are tested through Python simulations, thereby offering an overview of the different outcomes that the mechanics of our model can shape according to the contexts in which they operate.},

In particular, restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs) as specific classes of neural networks have been successfully applied in the context of physical feature extraction and representation learning. Despite these successes, however, there is only limited understanding of their representational properties and limitations. To better understand the representational characteristics of both generative neural networks, we study the ability of single RBMs and VAEs to capture physical features of the Ising model at different temperatures. This approach allows us to quantitatively assess learned representations by comparing sample features with corresponding theoretical predictions. Our results suggest that the considered RBMs and convolutional VAEs are able to capture the temperature dependence of magnetization, energy, and spin-spin correlations. The samples generated by RBMs are more evenly distributed across temperature than those of VAEs. We also find that convolutional layers in VAEs are important to model spin correlations.},

  abstract = {The study reported in this paper assesses the fit of a 21-item instrument measuring values in the second round of the European Social Survey (ESS) to the theory of 10 basic values on which it was based (Schwartz 1992). In particular, the measurement invariance of this instrument for studying value priorities across nations and over time was investigated. In the first part of the study, using multi-group confirmatory factor analysis (MGCFA) of data from the second ESS round, configural, metric, and scalar invariance of the values are assessed across 25 countries. Metric invariance is a necessary condition to insure equivalence of the meaning of factors and a precondition for comparing values' correlates. Scalar invariance is a precondition for comparing value means. The MGCFA did not support configural and metric invariance across 25 countries. After reducing the number of countries to 14, the MGCFA supported metric invariance of the same model found for the data of Round 1 (Davidov, Schmidt, and Schwartz in press) with seven distinct values. These value measurements may now be used by researchers to study relationships among values, attitudes, behavior, and sociodemographic characteristics across the 14 nations. Comparing national value means may be possible only across a smaller set of countries where scalar invariance holds. In the second part of the study, metric and scalar invariance were established between the first and the second rounds of the ESS in each of 19 countries separately. In 9 countries, the model found for the data of Round 1 also fitted the longitudinal comparison, but in 10 countries model modifications were needed. Value means may be compared for each of the countries between the first and second ESS rounds (2002-2003 and 2004-2005, respectively).},

However, meaningful comparisons of means or relationships between constructs within and across nations require equivalent measurements of these constructs. This is especially true for subjective attributes such as values, attitudes, opinions, or behavior. In this review, we first discuss the concept of cross-group measurement equivalence, look at possible sources of nonequivalence, and suggest ways to prevent it. Next, we examine the social science methodological literature for ways to empirically test for measurement equivalence. Finally, we consider what may be done when equivalence is not supported by the data and conclude with a review of recent developments that offer exciting directions and solutions for future research in cross-national measurement equivalence assessment.},

Furthermore, it explains the dangers associated with ignoring non-invariance before comparing the values across nations or over time, and specifically describes how invariance may be tested. After initially determining how many values can be identified for each country separately, the comparability of value measurements across countries is assessed using multigroup confirmatory factor analysis (MGCFA). This is necessary to allow later comparisons of values' correlates and means across countries. Finally, invariance of values over time (2002\textendash 07) is tested. Such invariance allows estimating aggregate value change and comparing it across countries meaningfully. In line with past results, only four to seven values can be identified in each country. Analyses reveal that the ESS value measurements are not suitable for measuring the 10 values; therefore, some adjacent values are unified. Furthermore, a subset of eight countries displays metric invariance for seven values, and metric invariance for six values is found for 21 countries.This finding indicates that values in these countries have similar meanings, and their correlates may be compared but not their means. Finally, temporal scalar invariance is evidenced within countries and over time thus allowing longitudinal value change to be studied in all the participating countries.},

DT reframes causal inference as "assisted decision-making", and aims to understand when, and how, I can make use of external data, typically observational, to help me solve a decision problem by taking advantage of assumed relationships between the data and my problem. The relationships embodied in any representation of a causal problem require deeper justification, which is necessarily context-dependent. Here we clarify the considerations needed to support applications of the DT methodology. Exchangeability considerations are used to structure the required relationships, and a distinction drawn between intention to treat and intervention to treat forms the basis for the enabling condition of "ignorability". We also show how the DT perspective unifies and sheds light on other popular formalisations of statistical causality, including potential responses and directed acyclic graphs.},

  abstract = {A dynamic system is a set of interacting elements characterized by changes occurring over time. The estimation of derivatives is a mainstay for exploring dynamics of constructs, particularly when the dynamics are complicated or unknown. The presence of measurement error in many social science constructs frequently results in poor estimates of derivatives, as even modest proportions of measurement error can compound when estimating derivatives. Given the overlap in the specification of latent differential equation models and latent growth curve models, and the equivalence of latent growth curve models and mixed models under some conditions, derivatives could be estimated from estimates of random effects. This article proposes a new method for estimating derivatives based on calculating the Empirical Bayes estimates of derivatives from a mixed model. Two simulations compare four derivative estimation methods: Generalized Local Linear Approximation, Generalized Orthogonal Derivative Estimates, Functional Data Analysis, and the proposed Empirical Bayes Derivative Estimates. The simulations consider two data collection scenarios: short time series ({$\leq$}10 observations) from many individuals or occasions, and long individual time series (25\textendash 500 observations). A substantive example visualizing the dynamics of intraindividual positive affect time series is also presented.},

Reporting little evidence of mass polarization, previous studies assume polarization is evidenced via the amplification of existing political alignments. This article considers a different pathway: polarization occurring via social, cultural, and political alignments coming to encompass an increasingly diverse array of opinions and attitudes. The study uses 44 years of data from the General Social Survey representing opinions and attitudes across a wide array of domains as elements in an evolving belief network. Analyses of this network produce evidence that mass polarization has increased via a process of belief consolidation, entailing the collapse of previously cross-cutting alignments, thus creating increasingly broad and encompassing clusters organized around cohesive packages of beliefs. Further, the increasing salience of political ideology and partisanship only partly explains this trend. The structure of U.S. opinion has shifted in ways suggesting troubling implications for proponents of political and social pluralism.},

Our model shows a surprisingly rich dynamics despite its simplicity. An analytical mean-field approach, confirmed by numerical simulations, allows us to build a phase diagram and to predict if and how consensus is reached.

Previous studies mainly viewed the issue of ISS as a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) problem, and therefore used MCDM methods to investigate it. However, many important aspects, for example, the dynamic process of ISS, the impact of different kinds of factors on ISS, and the stability of the solution of ISS, have not attracted enough attention and are still lacked of deep investigation. In this paper, an evolutionary game model is proposed to study this issue from theoretical perspective. That is to say, an ISS game is developed to formalize the interaction relationship between information sources, and replicator equation about population dynamics is used to mimick the dynamically evolutionary process in ISS. Within the proposed model, two kinds of factors, subjective factors and objective factors, have been separately considered and their respective influence on ISS has been distinguished. Furthermore, the dynamic process of ISS is presented clearly, and the stability of the solution is also investigated mathematically. Illustrative examples show that the proposed model sheds new light into the issue of ISS.},

This problem set-up arises in the context of social networks and opinion dynamics, where reaching consensus means that the opinions of the agents in the same cluster converge to the same decision. The consensus problem is here investigated under the assumption that agents in the same cluster have the same constant and pre-fixed amount of trust (/distrust) to be distributed among their cooperators (/adversaries). The proposed solution establishes how much agents in the same group must be conservative about their opinions in order to converge to a common decision.},

  abstract = {The richness that characterizes relationships is often absent when they are modeled using computational methods in network science. Typically, relationships are represented simply as links, perhaps with weights. The lack of finer granularity is due in part to the fact that, aside from linkage and strength, no fundamental or immediately obvious dimensions exist along which to categorize relationships. Here we propose a set of dimensions that capture major components of many relationships -- derived both from relevant academic literature and people's everyday descriptions of their relationships. We first review prominent findings in sociology and social psychology, highlighting dimensions that have been widely used to categorize social relationships. Next, we examine the validity of these dimensions empirically in two crowd-sourced experiments. Ultimately, we arrive at a set of ten major dimensions that can be used to categorize relationships: similarity, trust, romance, social support, identity, respect, knowledge exchange, power, fun, and conflict. These ten dimensions, while not dispositive, offer higher resolution than existing models. Indeed, we show that one can more accurately predict missing links in a social graph by using these dimensions than by using a state-of-the-art link embeddedness method. We also describe tinghy.org, an online platform we built to collect data about how social media users perceive their online relationships, allowing us to examine these dimensions at scale. Overall, by proposing a new way of modeling social graphs, our work aims to contribute both to theory in network science and practice in the design of social-networking applications.},

Does identity-based mobilization by political parties persist or subside with development? I propose a theory of electoral competition that highlights why the L-R dimension can appear unimportant in developing countries, even if it is salient to voters. Competitive pressures force parties to cluster together on the L-R dimension in developing democracies, even if they are ideologically opposed. Economic development creates a larger affluent class, which leads parties to diverge more along the L-R dimension, thereby increasing its political salience. The right party mobilizes more along ethnic lines when parties compete on both economic policies and identity. In contrast, the relationship between development and the political salience of ethnicity depends on the correlation between ethnic preferences and economic class. When ethnic preferences are independent of economic class, development increases ethnic mobilization.},

The present work aims to broaden the scope of studies focusing on referees' networks. For this purpose, we built referees' networks of all World Cup competitions to date. We used indices based on the clique approach for the analyses and characterization of the networks, and the detection of clusters was investigated by identifying communities and islands. Some important results emerge from this study, such as the finding that the networks do not follow a pattern throughout their editions with respect to the indices and the structure. There is, however, a change in procedures from the 2006 World Cup with respect to referee choice. This change leads to the emergence of a pattern in the last four World Cups.},

First, if a minimally interesting effect size can be specified, a null interval is defined as the effects smaller in magnitude than the minimally interesting effect. Then the proportion of the posterior distribution that falls in the null interval indicates the plausibility of the null interval hypothesis. Second, if a rough scale of effect can be determined, a Bayes factor can indicate evidence for a model representing that scale of effect versus a model of H0. Both methods allow data to count against a theory that predicts a difference. By contrast, non-significance does not count against such a theory.},

Specifying relevant effect sizes for power, or the equivalence region for equivalence testing, or the scale factor for Bayes factors, is necessary for many journal formats, such as registered reports, and should be necessary for all articles that use hypothesis testing.

In the asymptotics of grazing interactions, the solution density of the Boltzmann type kinetic equation is shown to converge towards the solution of a Fokker--Planck type equation with variable coefficients of diffusion and drift, characterized by the mathematical properties of the value function. The steady states of the statistical distribution of the social status predicted by the Fokker--Planck equations belong to the class of Amoroso distributions with Pareto tails, which correspond to the emergence of a \textbackslash emph\{social elite\}. The details of the microscopic kinetic interaction allow to clarify the meaning of the various parameters characterizing the resulting equilibrium. Numerical results then show that the steady state of the underlying kinetic equation is close to Amoroso distribution even in an intermediate regime in which interactions are not grazing.},

Based on the assumption that the posts of these users are topic-specific, can we identify temporal connectivity patterns that emerge from the use of specific attributes? More challengingly, are there any particular attribute usage patterns which indicate an inherent anomaly either for users or attributes? Our study attempts to provide solid answers to all the above questions, extending previous work on other social networks and attribute types. We propose TRIAGE, a pipeline of methods which : (a) identify temporal behavioral patterns in individual attribute distributions, (b) model the temporal evolution of attribute induced graphs and (c) detect irregular attributes and users based on the patterns identified earlier; More specifically, we model the attribute distributions using the log-Odds ratio, we provide explanations with respect to the attribute induced subgraph patterns and we observe the structural differences of attribute induced subgraphs based on these patterns. Experimental results show that : most of the individual attribute distributions remain stable over time following mostly power laws norm; the temporal evolution of attribute induced graphs obey certain laws and deviations are outliers; finally, we discover that we can indeed identify the structure of each subgraph, based on the emerging patterns. Real dataset experiments on 50K Twitter users activities and attributes has successfully proven that TRIAGE has effectively identified Twitter user and attribute behavioral patterns and can identify irregular activities for users and anomalous graph structures for attribute induced subgraphs.},

However, the disadvantage of these community similarity-based methods is the resolution of prediction accuracy is very low, which resulting in the existence probability of the missing links between node-pairs within a community or between a specific pair of communities is the same. In addition, the link prediction algorithms which based on multi-resolution community division can calculate the existence probability of missing links under different resolutions, but the relevance between communities had not taken into account, which makes it difficult to predict the existence probability of target links if the number of interconnections between communities is small. Combining the advantages of these two algorithms, we propose a more realistic link prediction model which based on a novel quasi-local community relevance index under multi-resolution community division. The performance of our algorithms is demonstrated by comparing with other well-known methods on two kinds of networks in different scales.

The first sample (N = 546) was assessed using a short instrument, the second (N = 404) and the third (N = 410) samples were assessed with full instruments for the first three dark traits, while for sadism the same instrument was used in all three studies. The results showed that psychopathy is the central feature across all networks, especially its facets which correspond to primary psychopathy or interpersonal manipulation and callousness. Narcissism seemed redundant when total scores of the dark traits were analyzed, but these results should be interpreted with caution given the small number of variables in the network. However, on the facet level, some facets of psychopathy were redundant (secondary psychopathy or lack of cognitive responsiveness). These results reiterate the importance of psychopathy in the core of the dark traits and provide a deeper insight into the relations between the Dark Tetrad traits.},

The research was conducted on a sample from the general population using subscales of four narcissism instruments (Narcissism Personality Inventory, Grandiose Narcissism Scale, Pathological Narcissism Inventory, Five-Factor Narcissism Inventory Short Form). The results revealed detection of four communities, one of which was interpreted as vulnerable narcissism, while the remaining three were interpreted as aspects of grandiose narcissism (grandiose exhibitionism, narcissistic antagonism, and authority). The results suggested that although features of grandiose narcissism (grandiose exhibitionism and leadership/authority) show consistent higher strength centrality across networks, entitlement/exploitativeness, followed by grandiose fantasy, has a central role in bringing together maladaptive grandiose and vulnerable aspects of narcissism. In addition, leadership/authority brings together various aspects of grandiose narcissism. The results support the role of entitlement features as the core of narcissism.},

For the ensemble model, the utterance representations taken from those individual models are concatenated and fed into a linear decoder to make the final decisions. Our ensemble model outperforms the individual models and shows up to 8.6\% improvement over the individual models on the development set. On the test set, it achieves macro-F1 of 90.9\% and becomes one of the high performing systems among 85 participants in the sub-task A of this shared task.

The iDBN can infer every aspect of a DBN: the number of hidden factors, the number of values each factor can take, and (arbitrarily complex) connections and conditionals between factors and observations. In this way, the iDBN generalizes other nonparametric state space models, which until now generally focused on binary hidden nodes and more restricted connection structures. We show how this new prior allows us to find interesting structure in benchmark tests and on two realworld datasets involving weather data and neural information flow networks.},

The literature roughly suggests that network structure is such that networks have an ``inner'' highly-connected nucleus and, in contrast, sparse outer shells. But to what extent is the existence of this nucleus crucial for the survival of a network? To what extent is the outer shells' much larger population essential to the longevity of the network? Furthermore, as a network grows and forms, theoretically speaking, network structure should be dependent on the patterns of change of degree centrality, i.e., social mobility between centrality shells. What is the role of social mobility in the formation of the nucleus-to-periphery profile, and is it related to network lifetime? Here, we explore these questions using data collected covering over a decade of activity from more than 10, 000 networked communities, with more than 134,000 users. We find that: (i) social mobility is, on average, negative but that, (ii) the higher the social mobility of the members of the network, the more stable and long-living the network is. Further, (iii) the network is, indeed, composed of two phases - a large but ephemeral sparsely connected ``cloud'' of actors, that nucleates around a highly stable nucleus of users. Lastly, (iv) networked communities which maintain a specific nucleus-to-periphery ratio {$\eta$}, i.e., a ratio of the size of the nucleus to periphery of around \$\$ \textbackslash eta =\textbackslash frac\{1\}\{4\} \$\$ , have a greater chance of survival. We find that deviations from this nucleus-to-periphery ratio predict a collapse of network activity, especially in the case of younger communities.},

In spite of the important role of these proliferating communities, there is limited empirical evidence that identifies the dominant factors underlying their dynamics. Using data collected from seven large online platforms, we observe a relationship between online community size and its activity which generally repeats itself across platforms: First, in most platforms, three distinct activity regimes exist\textemdash one of low-activity and two of high-activity. Further, we find a sharp activity phase transition at a critical community size that marks the shift between the first and the second regime in six out of the seven online platforms. Essentially, we argue that it is around this critical size that sustainable interactive communities emerge. The third activity regime occurs above a higher characteristic size in which community activity reaches and remains at a constant and higher level. We find that there is variance in the steepness of the slope of the second regime, that leads to the third regime of saturation, but that the third regime is exhibited in six of the seven online platforms. We propose that the sharp activity phase transition and the regime structure stem from the branching property of online interactions.},

Yet, the question of how a group's survival depends on its social structure is not well understood. In an analysis of more than 10\,122 real-life online communities (with a total of 134\,147 members) hosted by a leading platform over periods of more than a decade, we observe a prominent structural difference between stable and unstable communities, enabling the prediction of sustainability up to a decade ahead. We find that communities that fail to maintain a typical hierarchical social structure that preserves cohesiveness across size scales do not survive, while communities that exhibit such balance prevail. This difference is observable in as early as the first 30 days of a community's lifetime, enabling prediction of community sustainability up to 10 years in the future. We theorize that communities comprising distinct social structures that balance global and local factors across scales of sizes are more likely to maintain sustainability.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}A discrete statistical model is a subset of a probability simplex. Its maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) is a retraction from that simplex onto the model. We characterize all models for which this retraction is a rational function. This is a contribution via real algebraic geometry which rests on results due to Huh and Kapranov on Horn uniformization. We present an algorithm for constructing models with rational MLE, and we demonstrate it on a range of instances. Our focus lies on models familiar to statisticians, like Bayesian networks, decomposable graphical models, and staged trees. {$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Social network structure is one of the key determinants of human language evolution. Previous work has shown that the network of social interactions shapes decentralized learning in human groups, leading to the emergence of different kinds of communicative conventions. We examined the effects of social network organization on the properties of communication systems emerging in decentralized, multi-agent reinforcement learning communities. We found that the global connectivity of a social network drives the convergence of populations on shared and symmetric communication systems, preventing the agents from forming many local ``dialects''. Moreover, the agent's degree is inversely related to the consistency of its use of communicative conventions. These results show the importance of the basic properties of social network structure on reinforcement communication learning and suggest a new interpretation of findings on human convergence on word conventions.},

  pages = {12},
  abstract = {The goal of item response theoretic (IRT) models is to provide estimates of latent traits from binary observed indicators and at the same time to learn the item response functions (IRFs) that map from latent trait to observed response. However, in many cases observed behavior can deviate significantly from the parametric assumptions of traditional IRT models. Nonparametric IRT models overcome these challenges by relaxing assumptions about the form of the IRFs, but standard tools are unable to simultaneously estimate flexible IRFs and recover ability estimates for respondents. We propose a Bayesian nonparametric model that solves this problem by placing Gaussian process priors on the latent functions defining the IRFs. This allows us to simultaneously relax assumptions about the shape of the IRFs while preserving the ability to estimate latent traits. This in turn allows us to easily extend the model to further tasks such as active learning. GPIRT therefore provides a simple and intuitive solution to several longstanding problems in the IRT literature.},

  abstract = {In social sciences, the study of group differences concerning latent constructs is ubiquitous. These constructs are generally measured by means of scales composed of ordinal items. In order to compare these constructs across groups, one crucial requirement is that they are measured equivalently or, in technical jargon, that measurement invariance holds across the groups. This study compared the performance of multiple group categorical confirmatory factor analysis (MG-CCFA) and multiple group item response theory (MG-IRT) in testing measurement invariance with ordinal data. A simulation study was conducted to compare the true positive rate (TPR) and false positive rate (FPR) both at the scale and at the item level for these two approaches under an invariance and a noninvariance scenario. The results of the simulation studies showed that the performance, in terms of the TPR, of MG-CCFA- and MG-IRT-based approaches mostly depends on the scale length. In fact, for long scales, the likelihood ratio test (LRT) approach, for MG-IRT, outperformed the other approaches, while, for short scales, MG-CCFA seemed to be generally preferable. In addition, the performance of MG-CCFA's fit measures, such as RMSEA and CFI, seemed to depend largely on the length of the scale, especially when MI was tested at the item level. General caution is recommended when using these measures, especially when MI is tested for each item individually. A decision flowchart, based on the results of the simulation studies, is provided to help summarizing the results and providing indications on which approach performed best and in which setting.},

This field applies computational methods to novel sources of digital data such as social media, administrative records, and historical archives to develop theories of human behavior. We review the evolution of this field within sociology via bibliometric analysis and in-depth analysis of the following subfields where this new work is appearing most rapidly: (a) social network analysis and group formation; (b) collective behavior and political sociology; (c) the sociology of knowledge; (d) cultural sociology, social psychology, and emotions; (e) the production of culture; ( f ) economic sociology and organizations; and (g) demography and population studies. Our review reveals that sociologists are not only at the center of cutting-edge research that addresses longstanding questions about human behavior but also developing new lines of inquiry about digital spaces as well. We conclude by discussing challenging new obstacles in the field, calling for increased attention to sociological theory, and identifying new areas where computational social science might be further integrated into mainstream sociology.

This combination of cognitive and social processes has outcomes that are qualitatively different from either only cognitive or only social processes, which shows the importance of studying these together. An illustration that moves towards representing the processes involved in Brexit is also exhibited to show the potential of this kind of simulation. Whilst only conceived of as an illustration of a kind of model, it is consistent with a number of observed patterns in opinion poll data, with some social and cognitive theories and only consists of plausible processes. This kind of model could also be used to relate and integrate different kinds of evidence into a coherent framework in the shape of more developed simulations.},

We contribute to filling this gap by accounting for different effects of competitiveness in democracies and autocracies, as well as against the background of varying institutional settings. Our analyses suggest that vote margins are a suitable measure of competitiveness, but only in democracies with plurality or majority electoral systems. Ex ante measures of competitiveness capture the concept of competitiveness more comprehensively and are applicable across electoral systems and regime types.},

Big data methodologies can augment this endeavour by allowing for the collection of naturalistic and personality-relevant digital traces from online environments. Whereas big data methods have primarily been used to catalogue static personality dimensions, here we present a case study in how they can be used to track dynamic fluctuations in psychological states. We apply a text-based, machine learning prediction model to Facebook status updates to compute weekly trajectories of emotional valence and arousal. We train this model on 2895 human-annotated Facebook statuses and apply the resulting model to 303 575 Facebook statuses posted by 640 US Facebook users who had previously self-reported their Big Five traits, yielding an average of 28 weekly estimates per user. We examine the correlations between model-predicted emotion and self-reported personality, providing a test of the robustness of these links when using weekly aggregated data, rather than momentary data as in prior work. We further present dynamic visualizations of weekly valence and arousal for every user, while making the final data set of 17 937 weeks openly available. We discuss the strengths and drawbacks of this method in the context of personality psychology's evolution into a dynamic science. \textcopyright{} 2020 European Association of Personality Psychology},

  abstract = {The problem of social spam detection has been traditionally modeled as a supervised classification problem. Despite the initial success of this detection approach, later analysis of proposed systems and detection features has shown that, like email spam, the dynamic and adversarial nature of social spam makes the performance achieved by supervised systems hard to maintain. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of using the output of previously proposed supervised classification systems as a tool for spammers discovery. The hypothesis is that these systems are still highly capable of detecting spammers reliably even when their recall is far from perfect. We then propose to use the output of these classifiers as prior beliefs in a probabilistic graphical model framework. This framework allows beliefs to be propagated to similar social accounts. Basing similarity on a who-connects-to-whom network has been empirically critiqued in recent literature and we propose here an alternative definition based on a bipartite users-content interaction graph. For evaluation, we build a Markov Random Field on a graph of similar users and compute prior beliefs using a selection of state-of-the-art classifiers. We apply Loopy Belief Propagation to obtain posterior predictions on users. The proposed system is evaluated on a recent Twitter dataset that we collected and manually labeled. Classification results show a significant increase in recall and a maintained precision. This validates that formulating the detection problem with an undirected graphical model framework permits to restore the deteriorated performances of previously proposed statistical classifiers and to effectively mitigate the effect of spam evolution.},

The incompleteness of data has different directions. The direction of interest in this manuscript is the collection of data whose measurements are sampled at equally spaced intervals with missing observations. This direction has two different scenarios: either for synchronously or non-synchronously recorded data. There are many known gap-filling techniques, however, each has its own limitations. In addition, the presence of gaps violates the underlying assumptions of the existing standard time series analysis techniques especially in the framework of Granger-causality concept, such as Directed Partial Correlation (DPC). This results in incorrect misleading conclusions about the inferred interaction structure. Therefore, the implications of applying the concept of Granger-causlaity based DPC are presented. To this end, a new extended methodology is proposed based on a specific shifting technique to overcome the shortcomings of the standard DPC technique. The proposed methodology provides an evidence that it is possible to infer the underlying causality structure even in the presence of gaps for non-synchronously recorded data.

This direction has two different scenarios: either for synchronously or non-synchronously recorded data. There are many known gap-filling techniques, however, each has its own limitations. In addition, the presence of gaps violates the underlying assumptions of the existing standard time series analysis techniques especially in the framework of Granger-causality concept, such as Directed Partial Correlation (DPC). This results in incorrect misleading conclusions about the inferred interaction structure. Therefore, the implications of applying the concept of Granger-causlaity based DPC are presented. To this end, a new extended methodology is proposed based on a specific shifting technique to overcome the shortcomings of the standard DPC technique. The proposed methodology provides an evidence that it is possible to infer the underlying causality structure even in the presence of gaps for non-synchronously recorded data. This manuscript presents the problem at hand for stock market time series analysis, as a case study.{$<$}/p{$><$}/div{$>$}},

  abstract = {All societies have been much more bipolar over the past few years, particularly after the emergence of online social networks and media. In fact, the gap between the two ends of social spectrum is going to be even deeper after the spread of new media. In this circumstance, social polarization has been a growing concern among socialists and computer science experts because of the detrimental impact which online social networks can have on societies by adding fuel to the fire of extremism. Several types of research were conducted for proposing measures to calculate the controversy level in social networks, afterward, to reduce controversy among contradicting viewpoints, for example, by exposing opinions of one side to other side's members. Most of the attempts for quantifying social networks' controversy have considered the networks in their most primary forms, without any attributes. Although these kinds of researches provide platform-free algorithms to be used in different social networks, they are not able to take into account a great deal of useful information provided by users (node attributes).To surmount this shortcoming, we propose a framework to be utilized in different networks with different attributes. We propelled some Biased Random Walks (BRW) to find their path from start point to an initially unknown endpoint with respect to initial energy of start node and energy loss of nodes on the path. We extracted structural attribute of networks, using node2vec, and compared it with state-of-the-art algorithms, and showed its accuracy. Then, we extracted some content attributes of user and analyze their effects on the results of our algorithm. BRW is compared with another state-of-the-art controversy measuring algorithm. Then, its changes in different level of controversy in Persian Twitter is considered to show how it works in different circumstance.},

New parties have emerged and been successful, thus radically changing the structure of inter-party competition. So far, research on new parties has been mainly conducted from party-level and election-centred perspectives. Here, instead, we focus on party system innovation (PSInn), meaning the impact of new parties on Western European party systems, and on the factors that explain such impact, by adopting a systemic perspective and taking into account all the arenas where inter-party competition takes place (i.e. elections, parliaments and governments). For this purpose, this article relies on an original dataset on the performances of new parties in terms of votes, seats, and ministerial posts, covering about 350 elections and 670 governments in 20 countries, over the period 1945\textendash 2017. The results of the analysis show a notable increase in PSInn over the last decade, in particular with regard to the electoral and parliamentary arenas. Moreover, data show that PSInn in the electoral and the parliamentary arenas is mainly predicted by turnout change, while in the governmental arena is instead driven by the country's economic performance.},

By relying on an original data set covering 20 countries and 344 parliamentary elections, this article presents the first analysis of West European `genuinely new parties' (GNPs) across time, countries and party families. We hypothesize that the parties differ not only in terms of their short- and long-term success but have a range of distinct development paths. Through a latent growth model, we provide a classification of GNPs in terms of their breakthrough and initial performance. According to the specific trajectory followed by new parties in the first five elections they contest, the model suggests five different classes of new parties in Western Europe: `explosive', `meteoric', `contender', `flat' and `flop'. The article discusses the implications of these findings also regarding the ability of the model to produce estimates and predictions about the future electoral performances of GNPs.},

Scholars have identified many factors correlated with support for Trump, but attempts at modeling these factors suffer from either multicollinearity, on the one hand, or omitted variable bias, on the other. Both obscure inferences. Using two national surveys, we demonstrate the perils of including or failing to include many of these factors in models. We then reconceptualize the sources of Trump support as components of perceived status threat; this ``profile'' of factors (e.g., attitudes towards women, minorities, and political correctness) strongly predicts Trump vote choice and general support, as well as attitudes about issues connected to Trump, controlling for other factors. Moreover, this profile outperforms partisanship and ideology as predictors of Trump support in most cases and is negatively related to support for mainstream Republican candidates. Our analyses suggest that Trump activated longstanding grievances that transcend traditional party cleavages.},

  abstract = {Conditional independence, graphical models and sparsity are key notions for parsimonious statistical models and for understanding the structural relationships in the data. The theory of multivariate and spatial extremes describes the risk of rare events through asymptotically justified limit models such as max-stable and multivariate Pareto distributions. Statistical modelling in this field has been limited to moderate dimensions so far, partly owing to complicated likelihoods and a lack of understanding of the underlying probabilistic structures. We introduce a general theory of conditional independence for multivariate Pareto distributions that allows the definition of graphical models and sparsity for extremes. A Hammersley-Clifford theorem links this new notion to the factorization of densities of extreme value models on graphs. For the popular class of H\textbackslash "usler-Reiss distributions we show that, similarly to the Gaussian case, the sparsity pattern of a general extremal graphical model can be read off from suitable inverse covariance matrices. New parametric models can be built in a modular way and statistical inference can be simplified to lower-dimensional marginals. We discuss learning of minimum spanning trees and model selection for extremal graph structures, and illustrate their use with an application to flood risk assessment on the Danube river.},

  abstract = {The usage of psychological networks that conceptualize behavior as a complex interplay of psychological and other components has gained increasing popularity in various research fields. While prior publications have tackled the topics of estimating and interpreting such networks, little work has been conducted to check how accurate (i.e., prone to sampling variation) networks are estimated, and how stable (i.e., interpretation remains similar with less observations) inferences from the network structure (such as centrality indices) are. In this tutorial paper, we aim to introduce the reader to this field and tackle the problem of accuracy under sampling variation. We first introduce the current state-of-the-art of network estimation. Second, we provide a rationale why researchers should investigate the accuracy of psychological networks. Third, we describe how bootstrap routines can be used to (A) assess the accuracy of estimated network connections, (B) investigate the stability of centrality indices, and (C) test whether network connections and centrality estimates for different variables differ from each other. We introduce two novel statistical methods: for (B) the correlation stability coefficient, and for (C) the bootstrapped difference test for edge-weights and centrality indices. We conducted and present simulation studies to assess the performance of both methods. Finally, we developed the free R-package bootnet that allows for estimating psychological networks in a generalized framework in addition to the proposed bootstrap methods. We showcase bootnet in a tutorial, accompanied by R syntax, in which we analyze a dataset of 359 women with posttraumatic stress disorder available online.},

  abstract = {A growing number of publications focuses on estimating Gaussian graphical models (GGMs, networks of partial correlation coefficients). At the same time, generalizibility and replicability of these highly parameterized models are debated, and sample sizes typically found in datasets may not be sufficient for estimating the underlying network structure. In addition, while recent work emerged that aims to compare networks based on different samples, these studies do not take potential cross-study heterogeneity into account. To this end, this paper introduces methods for estimating GGMs through aggregating over multiple datasets. We first introduce a general maximum likelihood estimation modeling framework in which all discussed models are embedded. This modeling framework is subsequently used to introduce meta-analytic Gaussian network aggregation (MAGNA). We discuss two variants: fixed-effects MAGNA, in which heterogeneity across studies is not taken into account, and random-effects MAGNA, which models sample correlations and takes heterogeneity into account. We exemplify the method using four datasets of post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms (Fried et al., 2017), as well as one large dataset of depression, anxiety and stress symptoms (Lovibond \& Lovibond, 1995). Finally, we assess the performance of MAGNA in large-scale simulation studies.},

The chapter starts with an introduction to the statistical model formulation of pairwise Markov random fields (PMRF), followed by an introduction of the PMRF suitable for binary data: the Ising model. The Ising model is a model used in ferromagnetism to explain phase transitions in a field of particles. Following the description of the Ising model in statistical physics, the chapter continues to show that the Ising model is closely related to models used in psychometrics. The Ising model can be shown to be equivalent to certain kinds of logistic regression models, loglinear models and multi-dimensional item response theory (MIRT) models. The equivalence between the Ising model and the MIRT model puts standard psychometrics in a new light and leads to a strikingly different interpretation of well-known latent variable models. The chapter gives an overview of methods that can be used to estimate the Ising model, and concludes with a discussion on the interpretation of latent variables given the equivalence between the Ising model and MIRT.},

  abstract = {Researchers in the field of network psychometrics often focus on the estimation of Gaussian graphical models (GGMs)\textemdash an undirected network model of partial correlations\textemdash between observed variables of cross-sectional data or single-subject time-series data. This assumes that all variables are measured without measurement error, which may be implausible. In addition, cross-sectional data cannot distinguish between within-subject and between-subject effects. This paper provides a general framework that extends GGM modeling with latent variables, including relationships over time. These relationships can be estimated from time-series data or panel data featuring at least three waves of measurement. The model takes the form of a graphical vector-autoregression model between latent variables and is termed the \emph{ts-lvgvar} when estimated from time-series data and the \emph{panel-lvgvar} when estimated from panel data. These methods have been implemented in the software package \emph{psychonetrics}, which is exemplified in two empirical examples, one using time-series data and one using panel data, and evaluated in two large-scale simulation studies. The paper concludes with a discussion on ergodicity and generalizability. Although within-subject effects may in principle be separated from between-subject effects, the interpretation of these results rests on the intensity and the time interval of measurement and on the plausibility of the assumption of stationarity.},

Gab is well known to be an extremist-friendly platform that performs little control on the posted content. Thus it represents an ideal benchmark for studying phenomena potentially related to polarization such as misinformation spreading. The combination of these factors may lead to hate as well as to episodes of harm in the real world. In this work we provide a characterization of the interaction patterns within Gab around the COVID-19 topic. To assess the spreading of different content type, we analyze consumption patterns based on both interaction type and source reliability. Overall we find that there are no strong statistical differences in the social response to questionable and reliable content, both following a power law distribution. However, questionable and reliable sources display structural and topical differences in the use of hashtags. The commenting behaviour of users in terms of both lifetime and sentiment reveals that questionable and reliable posts are perceived in the same manner. We can conclude that despite evident differences between questionable and reliable posts Gab users do not perform such a differentiation thus treating them as a whole. Our results provide insights toward the understanding of coordinated inauthentic behavior and on the early-warning of information operation.},

  abstract = {Community detection is a fundamental and important problem in network science, as community structures often reveal both topological and functional relationships between different components of the complex system. In this paper, we first propose a gradient descent framework of modularity optimization called vector-label propagation algorithm (VLPA), where a node is associated with a vector of continuous community labels instead of one label. Retaining weak structural information in vector-label, VLPA outperforms some well-known community detection methods, and particularly improves the performance in networks with weak community structures. Further, we incorporate stochastic gradient strategies into VLPA to avoid stuck in the local optima, leading to the stochastic vector-label propagation algorithm (sVLPA). We show that sVLPA performs better than Louvain Method, a widely used community detection algorithm, on both artificial benchmarks and real-world networks. Our theoretical scheme based on vector-label propagation can be directly applied to high-dimensional networks where each node has multiple features, and can also be used for optimizing other partition measures such as modularity with resolution parameters.},

  abstract = {Estimating conditional dependence graphs and precision matrices are some of the most common problems in modern statistics and machine learning. When data are fully observed, penalized maximum likelihood-type estimators have become standard tools for estimating graphical models under sparsity conditions. Extensions of these methods to more complex settings where data are contaminated with additive or multiplicative noise have been developed in recent years. In these settings, however, the relative performance of different methods is not well understood and algorithmic gaps still exist. In particular, in high-dimensional settings these methods require using non-positive semidefinite matrices as inputs, presenting novel optimization challenges. We develop an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm for these problems, providing a feasible algorithm to estimate precision matrices with indefinite input and potentially nonconvex penalties. We compare this method with existing alternative solutions and empirically characterize the tradeoffs between them. Finally, we use this method to explore the networks among US senators estimated from voting records data.},

This peculiarity inspires the current work: the adoption of text mining tools to evaluate if it is possible to infer typology and purpose of bots from the feelings and interests expressed in their posts. The experiments, carried out on a large corpus of Twitter data, show a connection between the two considered dimensions (feeling and interest) and the characteristics of the evolutionary waves of accounts.},

However, nodes may have multiple memberships in real-world networks. Recently, overlapping community detection has attracted lots of attention. With the good interpretability of latent vectors, in this paper, we improve non-negative matrix factorization method by incorporating affiliation preference. Other than directly approximating original adjacent matrix of network, our proposed Bayesian Affiliation Preference based Non-negative Matrix Factorization (BAPNMF) method maximizes the likelihood of affiliation preferences for all nodes. The intuition is that nodes prefer their neighbors than non-neighbors. We define the edge preference possibility which satisfies the totality based on generative affiliation model. In the learning phase, stochastic gradient descent with bootstrap sampling is adopted. We evaluated on both synthetic and real-world networks, and results show our method outperforms state-of-art algorithms and is scalable for large-scale networks.},

One can define a quality criterion for a community of a network in such a way that a high-quality community refers to a group of vertices that contains more highly-connected edges between its members than between its members and the rest of the network. Various algorithms have been developed to discover communities of networks, although there is not a straightforward solution to see which algorithms are good and how they are good. However, generating synthetic graphs, which are similar to real-world networks and also have a built-in community structure (known community structure), can be used in evaluating accurately different community detection algorithms. This paper presents and programs two very important categories of synthetic networks with known community structures. Afterward, it challenges several well-known community detection algorithms to discover communities in these networks.},

Few scholars examined, however, whether citizen preferences are adequately represented in enacted policies. The article addresses this gap in the literature and examines the role of electoral systems in fostering citizens-policy congruence. Building on studies of government congruence and responsiveness, we expect levels of policy congruence to be greater under majoritarian electoral systems than under proportional representation electoral systems and as the number of parties in government decreases. In order to test these expectations, we make use of data from the International Social Survey Programme and examine the proportions of respondents whose preferences are congruent with government levels of spending in eight major policy domains. Overall, the results do not support our expectations and indicate that levels of policy congruence are similar across electoral systems and government types. In line with recent works on electoral systems and representation, our findings support the claim that majoritarian and proportional representation electoral systems both have mechanisms which allow governments to represent their citizens similarly.},

First, factor analysis is applied to investigate if the theoretical distinction between teacher-directed and student-centred practices is generalizable across countries. Then, network analysis is used to explore how individual classroom assessment practices relate to either teacher-directed or student-centred practices. Main findings include that: (1) teacher-directed and student-centred practices are two distinct factors across countries; (2) the overall structure and connectivity of teaching practices differs across countries, with smaller differences within linguistic/cultural clusters; and (3) assessment practices with the aim to structure and guide learning strongly relate to teacher-directed practices, whereas assessment practices with the aim to individualize instruction more relate to student-centred practices. We discuss the global patterning and implications.},

Axelrod\^a\texteuro\texttrademark s question highlighted an ongoing quest for formal theoretical answers joined by researchers from a wide range of disciplines. Numerous models have been developed to understand why and under what conditions diversity in beliefs, attitudes and behavior can co-exist with the fact that very often in interactions, social influence reduces differences between people. Reviewing three prominent approaches, we discuss the theoretical ingredients that researchers added to classic models of social influence as well as their implications. Then, we propose two main frontiers for future research. First, there is urgent need for more theoretical work comparing, relating and integrating alternative models. Second, the field suffers from a strong imbalance between a proliferation of theoretical studies and a dearth of empirical work. More empirical work is needed testing and underpinning micro-level assumptions about social influence as well as macro-level predictions. In conclusion, we discuss major roadblocks that need to be overcome to achieve progress on each frontier. We also propose that a new generation of empirically-based computational social influence models can make unique contributions for understanding key societal challenges, like the possible effects of social media on societal polarization.},

This article examines the assessment of deliberativeness suggested by two sophisticated contemporary measurements of democratic quality, that is, the Democracy Barometer and the Varieties of Democracy-project. We feature two sets of challenges, each measurement of deliberativeness must meet: First, it must address the methodological challenges arising in the course of conceptualizing, operationalizing, and aggregating complex concepts (see Munck and Verkuilen, 2002). Second, attempts to measure nation states' deliberativeness are confronted with specific conceptual and systematic challenges which we derive from recent deliberative democracy scholarship. We argue that both Democracy Barometer and Varieties of Democracy-project provide highly sophisticated assessments of democratic quality, but ultimately fail to capture nation states ``deliberativeness'' in a theoretically reflected and methodologically sound manner. We examine the methodological, pragmatic, and systematic reasons for these shortcomings. The crucial task for measurements of nation states' deliberativeness consists in providing a conceptual approach and methodological framework for ``upscaling'' existing meso-level measurements (such as the DQI). The concluding section presents conceptual and methodological strategies that can enable researchers to meet these challenges and to provide a theoretically grounded and empirically valid measurement of nation states' deliberativeness.},

It has many useful applications in social networks such as friend recommendation, identification of future collaborations between authors in co-authorship networks, discovery of hidden groups of terrorists and criminals, among others. In general, the state-of-the-art link prediction methods consider topological data extracted from the current state (i.e., the most recent and available snapshot) of a network. They do not take into account information that describes how the network's topology was at the moments when the existing edges were created. Hence, those methods take the chance to disregard information about the circumstances that may have influenced the appearance of old edges, and that could be useful to predict the creation of new ones. Thus, this study raises and evaluates the hypothesis that recovering such data may contribute to improving link prediction. This hypothesis is justified since those data enrich the description of the application's context with examples that represent exactly the kind of event to be foreseen: the creation of new connections. To this end, this paper proposes a new link prediction method that is based on edge creation history retrieval. Results from experiments with twenty scenarios of four real co-authorship social networks presented statistical evidence that indicates the effectiveness of the proposed method and confirms the raised hypothesis.},

  abstract = {We study the distribution of preference votes across politicians with different behaviors and attitudes. There are two main findings. First, preference votes are concentrated to politicians who are more active in communicating their policy proposals and policy priorities. This suggests that preference voting may incentivize more transparency and communication among politicians, and, hence, be positive for accountability. Second, preference votes are concentrated to politicians who are more\textemdash not less\textemdash loyal to the party in their voting decisions, and to politicians who's ideological and policy positions are mainstream\textemdash rather than extreme\textemdash compared to their party colleagues. Together with the first finding, this suggests that preference voting can strengthen the bond of accountability between voters and politicians without undercutting parties' ideological cohesion.},

The aim was to describe social inequalities in fertility patterns among women who gave birth between 2007 and 2016 in the city of Barcelona (Spain) by jointly evaluating the effect of individual and socioeconomic neighbourhood characteristics.MethodsWe conducted a multilevel study of women's individual characteristics (age, educational attainment, and country of origin) and neighbourhood characteristics (disposable household income, percentage of unemployment and percentage of foreigners).ResultsMultilevel modelling revealed significant variability in fertility across neighbourhoods after adjustment for individual explanatory variables. The fertility rate (FR) was higher in better educated women (adjusted relative risk: aRR 2.76), those aged 30\textendash 39 years (aRR 2.13), and in those born in Spain in relation to their respective reference groups. The FR was lowest in women with upper to post-secondary, non-tertiary education (aRR 0.86) who were born in high income countries (aRR 0.57). Women living in neighbourhoods with a low income (aRR 1.46) and with a higher unemployment (aRR 1.33) were more likely to have children. In contrast, women living in neighbourhoods with a lower percentage of foreigners had the lowest FR (aRR 0.81).ConclusionsThe neighbourhood's characteristics played an important role in fertility patterns, independently of women's individual characteristics. At the contextual level, the highest FR was found in the poorest settings, highlighting inequalities. At the individual level, the FR was highest among women with higher education and in their thirties.},

We then show that, provided \$G(V\_n, E\_n)\$ converges in the local weak sense to a marked Galton-Watson process, the dynamics of the process for a uniformly chosen vertex in \$V\_n\$ can be coupled, for any fixed \$k\$, to a process \$\textbackslash\{ \textbackslash mathcal\{R\}\_\textbackslash emptyset\^\{(r)\}: 0 \textbackslash leq r \textbackslash leq k\textbackslash\}\$ constructed on the limiting marked Galton-Watson process. Moreover, we derive sufficient conditions under which \$\textbackslash mathcal\{R\}\^\{(k)\}\_\textbackslash emptyset\$ converges, as \$k \textbackslash to \textbackslash infty\$, to a random variable \$\textbackslash mathcal\{R\}\^*\$ that can be characterized in terms of the so-called special endogenous solution to a branching distributional fixed-point equation. Our framework can be applied also to processes \$\textbackslash\{ \{\textbackslash bf R\}\^\{(k)\}: k \textbackslash geq 0\textbackslash\}\$ whose only source of randomness comes from the realization of the graph \$G(V\_n, E\_n)\$.},

Much less is known, however, about the consequences of compulsory voting on vote choice, and, in particular, about the quality of electoral decisions. In this paper, we explore the extent to which voters meaningfully engage in the electoral process or simply vote randomly because voting is required by law. We conducted a large online survey in Brazil during the 2018 national elections to assess if voters engage in random voting. We evaluate random voting for low-profile, low-information elected offices (state and federal legislators) and others that receive greater media coverage (governor and president) and evaluate the determinants of random voting for each of them. We find that: 1) random voting does not appear to be affected by social desirability bias; 2) there is substantial random voting under compulsory voting; 3) more voters tend to engage in random voting in low-profile, low-information elections, as compared to elections that receive greater media coverage; and, 4) interest in politics, education, and disposition to vote if voting were to be voluntary reduce random voting. Our findings carry important implications for the study of citizen participation and civic competence under compulsory voting and for democratic representation, more broadly.},

They identify considerable replicability issues, concluding that ``current `state-of-the-art' methods in the psychopathology network literature [\ldots ] are not well-suited to analyzing the structure of the relationships between individual symptoms''. Such strong claims require strong evidence, which the authors do not provide. FWMK identify low replicability by analyzing point estimates of networks; contrast low replicability with results of two statistical tests that indicate higher replicability, and conclude that these tests are problematic. We make four points. First, statistical tests are superior to the visual inspection of point estimates, because tests take into account sampling variability. Second, FWMK misinterpret the statistical tests in several important ways. Third, FWMK did not follow established recommendations when estimating networks in their first study, underestimating replicability. Fourth, FWMK draw conclusions about methodology, which does not follow from investigations of data, and requires investigations of methodology. Overall, we show that the ``poor replicability`` observed by FWMK occurs due to sampling variability and use of suboptimal methods. We conclude by discussing important recent simulation work that guides researchers to use models appropriate for their data, such as nonregularized estimation routines.},

The motivation of our generalization are social science applications of the standard model that do not comport with its steady state predictions. The proposed generalization relaxes the predictions that every node belonging to the same nontrivial strong component of a network must acquire the same fraction of its members' initial quantities and that the sink component(s) of the network must absorb all of the system's available initial quantity. For example, when applied to refugee flows from a nation in chaos to other nations on a network with one or more sink nations, the standard model predicts that all the refugees will be eventually located in the sink(s) of the network and none that will permanently locate themselves in the nations along the paths to the sink(s). We illustrate this and several other social science applications to which our proposed model is applicable.},

However, explanations of effects remain scarce, and a growing chorus of scholars argues that the replicability crisis has distracted from a crisis of theory. In the same decade, the empirical literature using factor and network models has grown rapidly. I discuss three ways in which this literature falls short of theory building and testing. First, statistical and theoretical models are conflated, leading to invalid inferences such as the existence of psychological constructs based on factor models, or recommendations for clinical interventions based on network models. I demonstrate this inferential gap in a simulation study on statistical equivalence: excellent model fit does little to corroborate a theory, regardless of quality or quantity of data. Second, researchers fail to explicate theories about psychological constructs, but use implicit causal beliefs to guide inferences. These latent theories have led to problematic best practices in psychological research where inferences are drawn based on one specific causal model that is assumed, but not explicated. Third, explicated theories are often weak theories: narrative and imprecise descriptions vulnerable to hidden assumptions and unknowns. They fail to make clear predictions, and it remains unclear whether statistical effects corroborate such theories or not. Weak theories are immune to refutation or revision. I argue that these three challenges to theory building and testing are common and harmful, and impede theory formation, failure, and reform. A renewed focus on theoretical psychology and formal models offers a way forward.},

What features of our ambient culture, then, could explain the simplistic and combative approach that populists seem to take to politics and policy, their impatience with political debate and deliberation, their willingness to set aside democratic legal forms and political norms, their nationalism, their personalization of politics, their inclination toward conspiracy theorizing, their fondness for fringe sources of information, and their suspicion of political, scientific, and media elites? Using focus group and survey data, we can understand these populist traits as reflections of the culture of ``democratic technocracy'': a regime in which we, the people, are assumed capable of rendering sound judgments about how to solve our social and economic problems. Whether or not this assumption is warranted, its cultural dominance seems likely to generate the ideas that populist citizens apparently take for granted.},

Decision trees and random forests enable data-driven modeling and are valuable tools to overcome limitations of least square regressions and validate existing results. We illustrate the relevant modeling steps required to carry out the two techniques by investigating the complex patterns of aggressiveness, dysfunctional parent-child interactions, and other risk factors for corporal punishment of children by their fathers. We replicate existing results on the corresponding risk factors, interpret the modeling outcomes, and describe the setting of relevant meta parameters in empirical practice.},

It is, however, not obvious whether a negative degree correlation between nearest neighbor nodes makes a scale-free network fractal. Here we examine the possibility that disassortativity in complex networks is the origin of fractality. To this end, maximally disassortative (MD) networks are prepared by rewiring edges while keeping the degree sequence of an initial uncorrelated scale-free network. We show that there are many MD networks with different topologies if the degree sequence is the same with that of the (u,v)-flower but most of them are not fractal. These results demonstrate that disassortativity does not cause the fractal property of networks. In addition, we suggest that fractality of scale-free networks requires a long-range repulsive correlation, in the sense of the shortest path distance, in similar degrees.},

Furthermore, as a baseline to determine the existence of intrinsic long-range degree correlations in a network other than inevitable correlations caused by the finite-size effect, the functional forms of these probability distributions for random networks are analytically evaluated within a mean-field approximation. The utility of our argument is demonstrated by applying it to real-world networks.},

The study uses data from the last 2012\textendash 2016 national-regional electoral cycle investigating both federal and regional election results. Following Ishiyama (2002) for the between-region level of analysis the Regional Party Vote Inequality index has been utilized. The Party Nationalization Score proposed by Jones and Mainwaring (2003) has been applied to the measurement of voting territorial diversity at the within-region level. The results show that regional political factors may be still considered as major drivers of the nationalization of the vote as it did in the 1990s. The difference is that in politically recentralized Russia non-competitive regions headed by politically strong governors provides between-region inequality rather than contributing to nationalization. At the same time, the similarity continues in the ability of governors' ``political machines'' to contribute homogeneity of the vote, but only within their regions.},

Communication between disciplines is limited, and there is a lack of theoretical comparisons and empirical tests of the many different models of belief dynamics. Here we first review insights about structural components and processes of belief dynamics studied in different disciplines, focusing particularly on previously neglected but important areas such as cognitive representations and strategies used to integrate information. We then outline a unifying framework that enables theoretical and empirical comparisons of different belief dynamic models. The framework is quantified using a statistical physics formalism, grounded in cognitive and social theory as well as empirical observations. We show how the framework can be used to integrate numerous previous models and develop a more comprehensive science of belief dynamics.},

This paper proposes a model that links these two phenomena. In our set-up, the process of learning from others on a network is influenced by confirmation bias, i.e. the tendency to ignore contrary evidence and interpret it as consistent with one's own belief. When agents pay enough attention to themselves, confirmation bias leads to slower learning in any symmetric network, and it increases polarization in society. We identify a subset of agents that become more/less influential with confirmation bias. The socially optimal network structure depends critically on the information available to the social planner. When she cannot observe agents' beliefs, the optimal network is symmetric, vertex-transitive and has no self-loops. We explore the implications of these results for electoral outcomes and media markets. Confirmation bias increases the likelihood of shock elections, and it pushes fringe media to take a more extreme ideology.},

One major obstacle to researching this question is a lack of large labeled data sets for training automated classifiers to identify counter speech. Here we made use of a unique situation in Germany where self-labeling groups engaged in organized online hate and counter speech. We used an ensemble learning algorithm which pairs a variety of paragraph embeddings with regularized logistic regression functions to classify both hate and counter speech in a corpus of millions of relevant tweets from these two groups. Our pipeline achieved macro F1 scores on out of sample balanced test sets ranging from 0.76 to 0.97---accuracy in line and even exceeding the state of the art. On thousands of tweets, we used crowdsourcing to verify that the judgments made by the classifier are in close alignment with human judgment. We then used the classifier to discover hate and counter speech in more than 135,000 fully-resolved Twitter conversations occurring from 2013 to 2018 and study their frequency and interaction. Altogether, our results highlight the potential of automated methods to evaluate the impact of coordinated counter speech in stabilizing conversations on social media.},

  abstract = {During the present decade a large body of research has employed confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to evaluate the factor structure of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) across multiple languages and cultures. However, because CFA can produce strongly biased estimations when the population cross-loadings differ meaningfully from zero, it may not be the most appropriate framework to model the SDQ responses. With this in mind, the current study sought to assess the factorial structure of the SDQ using the more flexible exploratory structural equation modeling approach. Using a large-scale Spanish sample composed of 67,253 youths aged between 10 and 18 years (M = 14.16, SD = 1.07), the results showed that CFA provided a severely biased and overly optimistic assessment of the underlying structure of the SDQ. In contrast, exploratory structural equation modeling revealed a generally weak factorial structure, including questionable indicators with large cross-loadings, multiple error correlations, and significant wording variance. A subsequent Monte Carlo study showed that sample sizes greater than 4,000 would be needed to adequately recover the SDQ loading structure. The findings from this study prevent recommending the SDQ as a screening tool and suggest caution when interpreting previous results in the literature based on CFA modeling.},

  doi = {10.1073/pnas.1703857114},
  abstract = {{$<$}p id="p-6"{$>$}Human behavior is strongly affected by culturally transmitted norms and values. Certain norms are internalized (i.e., acting                               according to a norm becomes an end in itself rather than merely a tool in achieving certain goals or avoiding social sanctions).                               Humans' capacity to internalize norms likely evolved in our ancestors to simplify solving certain challenges\textemdash including social                               ones. Here we study theoretically the evolutionary origins of the capacity to internalize norms. In our models, individuals                               can choose to participate in collective actions as well as punish free riders. In making their decisions, individuals attempt                               to maximize a utility function in which normative values are initially irrelevant but play an increasingly important role                               if the ability to internalize norms emerges. Using agent-based simulations, we show that norm internalization evolves under                               a wide range of conditions so that cooperation becomes ``instinctive.'' Norm internalization evolves much more easily and has                               much larger effects on behavior if groups promote peer punishment of free riders. Promoting only participation in collective                               actions is not effective. Typically, intermediate levels of norm internalization are most frequent but there are also cases                               with relatively small frequencies of ``oversocialized'' individuals willing to make extreme sacrifices for their groups no matter                               material costs, as well as ``undersocialized'' individuals completely immune to social norms. Evolving the ability to internalize                               norms was likely a crucial step on the path to large-scale human cooperation.                            {$<$}/p{$>$}},

Existing community detection methods in attributed networks are mostly applied in the detection of nonoverlapping communities and cannot be directly used to detect the overlapping structures. This article proposes an overlapping community detection algorithm in attributed networks. First, we employ the modified X-means algorithm to cluster attributes to form different themes. Second, we employ the label propagation algorithm (LPA), which is based on neighborhood network conductance for priority and the rule of theme weight, to detect communities in each theme. Finally, we perform redundant processing to form the final community division. The proposed algorithm improves the X-means algorithm to avoid the effects of outliers. Problems of LPA such as instability of division and adjacent communities being easily merged can be corrected by prioritizing the node neighborhood network conductance. As the community is detected in the attribute subspace, the algorithm can find overlapping communities. Experimental results on real-attributed and synthetic-attributed networks show that the performance of the proposed algorithm is excellent with multiple evaluation metrics.},

Through these models we find latent classes of Europeans with similar levels of immigration acceptance, we study the effect of different socio-economic covariates on the probability of belonging to these classes, and we assess the item characteristics.

To illustrate the utility of this new index we explore its possible impact on government consumption.

Where indicators tap into common latent traits in theoretically meaningful ways, the problem may be solved by applying a data-informed (``inductive'') measurement model, for example, factor analysis, structural equation models, or item response theory. Where they do not, researchers solve the aggregation problem by appeal to concept-driven (``deductive'') criteria, that is, aggregation schemes that do not presume patterns of covariance across observable indicators. This article introduces a novel approach to scale construction that builds on the properties of concepts to solve the aggregation problem. This is accomplished by regarding conceptual attributes as necessary-and-sufficient conditions arrayed in an ordinal scale. While different sorts of scales are useful for different purposes, we argue that ``lexical'' scales are in many cases superior for research questions where it is relevant to combine the differentiation of an ordinal scale with the distinct, meaningful categories of a typology.},

  abstract = {Strategic network formation is a branch of network science that takes an economic perspective to the creation of social networks, considering that actors in a network form links in order to maximise some utility that they attain through their connections to other actors in the network. In particular, Jackson's Connections model, writes an actor's utility as a sum over all other actors that can be reached along a path in the network of a benefit value that diminishes with the path length. In this paper, we are interested in the ``social capital'' that an actor retains due to their position in the network. Social capital can be understood as an ability to bond with actors, as well as an ability to form a bridge that connects otherwise disconnected actors. This bridging benefit has previously been modelled in another ``structural hole'' network formation game, proposed by Kleinberg. In this paper, we develop an approach that generalises the utility of Kleinberg's game and combines it with that of the Connections model, to create a utility that models both the bonding and bridging capabilities of an actor with social capital. From this utility and its associated formation game, we derive a new centrality measure, which we dub ``structural hole centrality'', to identify actors with high social capital. We analyse this measure by applying it to networks of different types, and assessing its correlation to other centrality metrics, using a benchmark dataset of 299 networks, drawn from different domains. Finally, using one social network from the dataset, we illustrate how an actor's ``structural hole centrality profile'' can be used to identify their bridging and bonding value to the network.},

In fact, they form a parametric family of sparse random geometric graphs that are parametrized by a fractality parameter {$\nu$} which governs the strength of the fractal structure. FGNs are driven by the latent spatial geometry of Gaussian Multiplicative Chaos (GMC), a canonical model of fractality in its own right. We explore the natural question of detecting the presence of fractality and the problem of parameter estimation based on observed network data. Finally, we explore fractality in community structures by unveiling a natural stochastic block model in the setting of FGNs.},

  abstract = {Previous research has addressed the study of the well-being structure focusing on the separability among hedonic and eudaimonic dimensions by means of latent variable approaches. Diener's tripartite model of Subjective Well-Being has often been identified with hedonic well-being, while flourishing (i.e., positive functioning) has been classified as a proxy for eudaimonic well-being. Instead of pursuing a theory-driven approach, the structure of well-being dimensions can be retrieved by means of network psychometrics that is a highly informative, data-driven approach that allows the model structure to spontaneously emerge from the relationships among indicators. Furthermore, we propose a strength centrality decomposition that is able to summarize the influence of a specific indicator within its dimension and between the other dimensions. Contrary to the theoretical conjecture that the separability among well-being dimensions can be grounded on a hedonic and eudaimonic distinction, our results point to a categorization of the Diener's well-being indicators based on the type of information they convey, that is global evaluation of life satisfaction, positive and negative affective experiences, and perceived positive functioning in life.},

  abstract = {The proliferation of web-based social networks has lead to new innovations in social networking, particularly by allowing users to describe their relationships beyond a basic connection. In this dissertation, I look specifically at trust in web-based social networks, how it can be computed, and how it can be used in applications. I begin with a definition of trust and a description of several properties that affect how it is used in algorithms. This is complemented by a survey of web-based social networks to gain an understanding of their scope, the types of relationship information available, and the current state of trust.  The computational problem of trust is to determine how much one person in the network should trust another person to whom they are not connected. I present two sets of algorithms for calculating these trust inferences: one for networks with binary trust ratings, and one for continuous ratings. For each rating scheme, the algorithms are built upon the defined notions of trust. Each is then analyzed theoretically and with respect to simulated and actual trust networks to determine how accurately they calculate the opinions of people in the system. I show that in both rating schemes the algorithms presented can be expected to be quite accurate.  These calculations are then put to use in two applications. FilmTrust is a website that combines trust, social networks, and movie ratings and reviews. Trust is used to personalize the website for each user, displaying recommended movie ratings, and ordering reviews by relevance. I show that, in the case where the user's opinion is divergent from the average, the trust-based recommended ratings are more accurate than several other common collaborative filtering techniques. The second application is TrustMail, an email client that uses the trust rating of each sender as a score for the message. Users can then sort messages according to their trust value.  I conclude with a description of other applications where trust inferences can be used, and how the lessons from this dissertation can be applied to infer information about relationships in other complex systems.}

Goldberg, Simon Lanz, Pascal Sciarini{$<$}/p{$><$}div xml:lang="en"{$><$}h5{$>$}Abstract{$<$}/h5{$><$}div{$><$}p{$>$}A well-established body of literature links voter turnout to political campaigns. In this view, intensive campaigns increase the perceived salience of a decision, fostering information-seeking and, ultimately, turnout. The existing literature has also advanced our understanding of how direct democratic institutions influence turnout in elections. Yet we still know little about whether and to what extent campaign efforts influence voter turnout in direct democratic votes, and we know even less about who is mobilized. We claim that campaign intensity has differentiated effects across voters, depending on voters' participation profile. To test this claim we use a rich dataset of official turnout data covering more than 40 direct democratic votes in Switzerland. The results support our claim. While intensive political campaigns overall foster citizens to turn out to vote, they do so especially for ``selective'' (or ``intermittent'') voters, who need to decide anew at each ballot whether to turn out or not. Interestingly, we also find that frequent abstainers are not immune from campaign effects, and get almost as strongly mobilized as selective voters in highly intensive campaigns.{$<$}/p{$><$}/div{$><$}/div{$>$}},

Recently, a new dimensionality assessment technique based on network psychometrics was proposed (Exploratory Graph Analysis, EGA), but a measure to check the fit of the dimensionality structure to the data estimated via EGA is still lacking. Although traditional factor-analytic fit measures are widespread, recent research has identified limitations for their effectiveness in categorical variables. Here, we propose three new fit measures (termed entropy fit indices) that combines information theory, quantum information theory and structural analysis: Entropy Fit Index (EFI), EFI with Von Neumman Entropy (EFI.vn) and Total EFI.vn (TEFI.vn). The first can be estimated in complete datasets using Shannon entropy, while EFI.vn and TEFI.vn can be estimated in correlation matrices using quantum information metrics. We show, through several simulations, that TEFI.vn, EFI.vn and EFI are as accurate or more accurate than traditional fit measures when identifying the number of simulated latent factors. However, in conditions where more factors are extracted than the number of factors simulated, only TEFI.vn presents a very high accuracy. In addition, we provide an applied example that demonstrates how the new fit measures can be used with a real-world dataset, using exploratory graph analysis.},

  abstract = {The estimation of the correct number of dimensions is a long-standing problem in psychometrics. Several methods have been proposed, such as parallel analysis (PA), Kaiser-Guttman's eigenvalue-greater-than-one rule, multiple average partial procedure (MAP), the maximum-likelihood approaches that use fit indexes as BIC and EBIC and the less used and studied approach called very simple structure (VSS). In the present paper a new approach to estimate the number of dimensions will be introduced and compared via simulation to the traditional techniques pointed above. The approach proposed in the current paper is called exploratory graph analysis (EGA), since it is based on the graphical lasso with the regularization parameter specified using EBIC. The number of dimensions is verified using the walktrap, a random walk algorithm used to identify communities in networks. In total, 32,000 data sets were simulated to fit known factor structures, with the data sets varying across different criteria: number of factors (2 and 4), number of items (5 and 10), sample size (100, 500, 1000 and 5000) and correlation between factors (orthogonal, .20, .50 and .70), resulting in 64 different conditions. For each condition, 500 data sets were simulated using lavaan. The result shows that the EGA performs comparable to parallel analysis, EBIC, eBIC and to Kaiser-Guttman rule in a number of situations, especially when the number of factors was two. However, EGA was the only technique able to correctly estimate the number of dimensions in the four-factor structure when the correlation between factors were .7, showing an accuracy of 100\% for a sample size of 5,000 observations. Finally, the EGA was used to estimate the number of factors in a real dataset, in order to compare its performance with the other six techniques tested in the simulation study.},

  abstract = {The past few years were marked by increased online offensive strategies perpetrated by state and non-state actors to promote their political agenda, sow discord and question the legitimacy of democratic institutions in the US and Western Europe. In 2016 the US congress identified a list of Russian state-sponsored Twitter accounts that were used to try to divide voters on a wide range of issues. Previous research used Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to estimate latent topics in data extracted from these accounts. Howerver, LDA is has characteristics that may pose significant limitations to be used in data from social media: the number of latent topics must be specified by the user, interpretability can be difficult to achieve, and it doesn't model short-term temporal dynamics. In the current paper we propose a new method to estimate latent topics in texts from social media termed Dynamic Exploratory Graph Analysis (DynEGA). We compare DynEGA and LDA in a Monte-Carlo simulation in terms of their capacity to estimate the number of simulated latent topics. Finally, we apply the DynEGA method to a large dataset with Twitter posts from state-sponsored right- and left-wing trolls during the 2016 US presidential election. The results show that DynEGA is substantially more accurate to estimate the number of simulated topics than several different LDA algorithms. Our empirical example shows that DynEGA revealed topics that were pertinent to several consequential events in the election cycle, demonstrating the coordinated effort of trolls capitalizing on current events in the U.S. This demonstrates the potential power of our approach for revealing temporally relevant information from qualitative text data.},

  abstract = {This article explores the potential of complex adaptive systems (CAS) theory to inform behaviour change research. A CAS describes a collection of heterogeneous agents interacting within a particular context, adapting to each other's actions. In practical terms, this implies that behaviour change is (1) socially and culturally situated; (2) highly sensitive to small baseline differences in individuals, groups, and intervention components; and (3) determined by multiple components interacting `chaotically'. Two approaches to studying CAS are briefly reviewed. Agent-based modelling is a computer simulation technique that allows researchers to investigate `what if' questions in a virtual environment. Applied qualitative research techniques, on the other hand, offer a way to examine what happens when an intervention is pursued in real-time, and to identify the sorts of rules and assumptions governing social action. Although these represent very different approaches to complexity, there may be scope for mixing these methods \textendash{} for example, by grounding models in insights derived from qualitative fieldwork. Finally, I will argue that the concept of CAS offers one opportunity to gain a deepened understanding of health-related practices, and to examine the social psychological processes that produce health-promoting or damaging actions.},

  abstract = {Objective:~This study aimed to analyze the associations among depressive and anxiety and pain symptoms in patients diagnosed with chronic pain.         Materials and Methods:~Four hundred fifty-four inpatients who were consecutively admitted in a multimodal 3-week treatment in a tertiary, psychosomatic university clinic completed 25 items from the Brief Pain Inventory and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale at baseline and after treatment termination. Associations among symptoms were explored by network analyses using the graphical least absolute shrinkage and selection operator to estimate their partial correlations, whereas Extended Bayesian Information Criterion was used to select the best network solution for the data. We explored symptoms' centrality and expected influence within the network and the minimum spanning tree for the network.         Results:~Besides expected associations within depressive and anxiety and pain symptoms, the estimated network showed several local associations between depressive and pain interference symptoms. The lacks of being cheerful and of laughing are 2 of the depressive symptoms that showed the greatest associations with pain interference and a strong centrality within the network. Sleep problems were associated with both anxiety and depressive symptoms and pain intensity symptoms. Although at posttreatment most of the symptoms showed a significant decrease, the strength of the associations between the symptoms within the network was significantly higher than at baseline.         Discussion:~The results support focusing psychosocial interventions in chronic pain treatment not only on reducing pain, anxiety, and sleep symptoms but also on enhancing positive affect. Future research is needed to replicate these findings using repeated within-person measures designs.},

The participants in online discussions constitute a complex network system; however, until now, there are few studies that have proposed a definition and measurement of network rationality from a systematic perspective, which makes us unable to assess the rationality of a network reasonably. In this paper, we propose a definition and measurement of network rationality. Then, we build a model based on the fraction of rational nodes and homophily to simulate the generation of social networks, and we reveal their influence on network rationality and irrational information diffusion on a network. Our preliminary results show that a network with higher rationality will create a ''virtuous circle'' more easily than a network with lower rationality, even if they have exactly the same initial number of rational nodes. In addition, the higher the rationality of a network is, the weaker the influence of the irrational information on the network will be.},

We used principles borrowed from infectious diseases modeling to track the changes of the membership of each political party taking into consideration preferences. The whole population was assumed to be constant and homogeneously mixed. Steady states were analytically obtained and their stability nature discussed. Conditions for the existence of single parties and the existence of both parties were obtained. Numerical simulations were also performed to support the analytical results.

Using data from a nationally representative sample of 10,765 Americans, we compare extremely sophisticated individuals (e.g., people with doctorates) and extremely unsophisticated individuals (e.g., high school dropouts) to demonstrate that neither education nor political interest affect value structure and crystallization.

In this paper, we consider an ellipsoidal alpha mixing strictly stationary process and discuss the discriminant analysis and propose a classification method based on binary time series. Assume that the observations are generated by time series which belongs to one of two categories described by different spectra. We propose a method to classify into the correct category with high probability. First, we will show that the misclassification probability tends to zero when the number of observation tends to infinity, that is, the consistency of our discrimination method. Further, we evaluate the asymptotic misclassification probability when the two categories are contiguous. Finally, we show that our classification method based on binary time series has good robustness properties when the process is contaminated by an outlier, that is, our classification method is insensitive to the outlier. However, the classical method based on smoothed periodogram is sensitive to outliers. We also deal with a practical case where the two categories are estimated from the training samples. For an electrocardiogram data set, we examine the robustness of our method when observations are contaminated with an outlier.},

  abstract = {We investigate the phenomenon of diffusion in a countably infinite society of individuals interacting with their neighbors in a network. At a given time, each individual is either active or inactive. The diffusion is driven by two characteristics: the network structure and the diffusion mechanism represented by an aggregation function. We distinguish between two diffusion mechanisms (probabilistic, deterministic) and focus on two types of aggregation functions (strict, Boolean). Under strict aggregation functions, polarization of the society cannot happen, and its state evolves towards a mixture of infinitely many active and infinitely many inactive agents, or towards a homogeneous society. Under Boolean aggregation functions, the diffusion process becomes deterministic and the contagion model of Morris (2000) becomes a particular case of our framework. Polarization can then happen. Our dynamics also allows for cycles in both cases. The network structure is not relevant for these questions, but is important for establishing irreducibility, at the price of a richness assumption: the network should contain infinitely many complex stars and have enough space for storing local configurations. Our model can be given a game-theoretic interpretation via a local coordination game, where each player would apply a best-response strategy in a random neighborhood.},

In reality, mistakes are a part of being human and incorrectly estimating the state of a peer is no exception. For instance, experimental studies show that whether we find a food 'healthy' also depends on the body size of those who eat it. In this paper, we introduce norm perception errors in models from common application areas of ABMs, namely computational sociology and public health. Using simulations, we examined whether an increase in perceptual uncertainty changed the outcome of the models reported by their authors. We found that the effect depends on the model: even frequent incorrect judgments by the agents had no effect in an eating model whereas correlations were statistically significant in a segregation model.},

We offer a formal analysis of the role of psychological and consumption needs in shaping the individual's choice of ideology under circumstances of uncertainty and limited resources and other constraints, including informational costs associated with learning about the potential match values of specific ideologies. After providing a few examples, we mention one non-obvious implication of our model, namely that people can be ``wrong'' about their own ideological preferences according to the criteria of rational consistency and utility maximization.},

  abstract = {Multidimensional scaling (MDS) models represent stimuli as points in a space consisting of a number of psychological dimensions, such that the distance between pairs of points corresponds to the dissimilarity between the stimuli. Two fundamental challenges in inferring MDS representations from data involve inferring the appropriate number of dimensions, and the metric structure of the space used to measure distance. We approach both challenges as Bayesian model-selection problems. Treating MDS as a generative model, we define priors needed for model identifiability under metrics corresponding to psychologically separable and psychologically integral stimulus domains. We then apply a differential evolution Markovchain Monte Carlo (DE-MCMC) method for parameter inference, and a Warp-III method for model selection. We apply these methods to five previous data sets, which collectively test the ability of the methods to infer an appropriate dimensionality and to infer whether stimuli are psychologically separable or integral. We demonstrate that our methods produce sensible results, but note a number of remaining technical challenges that need to be solved before the method can easily and generally be applied. We also note the theoretical promise of the generative modeling perspective, discussing new and extended models of MDS representation that could be developed.},

If the studies themselves are of high quality, meta-analysis can provide valuable insights into the current scientific state of knowledge about a particular phenomenon. In psychological science, the most common approach is to conduct frequentist metaanalysis. In this primer, we discuss an alternative method, Bayesian model-averaged meta-analysis. This procedure combines the results of four Bayesian meta-analysis models: (1) fixed-effect null hypothesis, (2) fixed-effect alternative hypothesis, (3) random-effects null hypothesis, and (4) random-effects alternative hypothesis. These models are combined according to their plausibilities in light of the observed data to address the two key questions ``Is the overall effect non-zero?'' and ``Is there between-study variability in effect size?''. Bayesian modelaveraged meta-analysis therefore avoids the need to select either a fixedeffect or random-effects model and instead takes into account model uncertainty in a principled manner.},

  abstract = {Envy, the inclination to compare rewards, can be expected to unfold when inequalities in terms of payoff differences are generated in competitive societies. It is shown that increasing levels of envy lead inevitably to a self-induced separation into a lower and an upper class. Class stratification is Nash stable and strict, with members of the same class receiving identical rewards. Upper class agents play exclusively pure strategies, all lower class agents the same mixed strategy. The fraction of upper class agents decreases progressively with larger levels of envy, until a single upper class agent is left. Numerical simulations and a complete analytic treatment of a basic reference model, the shopping trouble model, are presented. The properties of the class-stratified society are universal and only indirectly controllable through the underlying utility function, which implies that class stratified societies are intrinsically resistant to political control. Implications for human societies are discussed. It is pointed out that the repercussions of envy are amplified when societies become increasingly competitive.},

At the same time, the taboo does not prevent researchers from interpreting findings as causal effects\textemdash the inference is simply made implicitly, and assumptions remain unarticulated. Thus, we recommend that nonexperimental psychologists begin to talk openly about causal assumptions and causal effects. Only then can researchers take advantage of recent methodological advances in causal reasoning and analysis and develop a solid understanding of the underlying causal mechanisms that can inform future research, theory, and policy makers.},

First, we propose to construct the concept lattice family CLF to represent the different objects and relations of the heterogeneous social networks based on the relational concept analysis techniques. Then after we introduce a new algorithm that explores such CLF and extract the multidimensional communities.

Based on inductive qualitative observations, this article proposes a theoretical typology of two dimensions of theoretical resources and position orientations to describe left-wing social thoughts communicated in online space. Empirically, we used a mixed approach, an integration of case observations and big-data analyses of Weibo tweets, to investigate three types of left-leaning social thoughts. The identified left-leaning social thoughts include state-centered leftism, populist leftism, and liberal leftism, which are consistent with the proposed theoretical typology. State-centered leftism features strong support of the state and the current regime and a negative attitude toward the West, populist leftism is characterized by unequivocal affirmation of the revolutionary legacy and support for disadvantaged grassroots, and liberal leftism harbors a grassroots position and a decided affirmation of individual rights. In addition, we used supervised machine learning and social network analysis techniques to identify online communities that harbor the afore-mentioned left-leaning social thoughts and analyzed the interaction patterns within and across communities as well as the evolutions of community structures. We found that during the study period of 2012\textendash 2014, the liberal leftists gradually declined and the corresponding communities dissolved; the interactions between populist leftists and state-centered leftists intensified, and the ideational cleavage between these two camps increased the online confrontations. This article demonstrates that the mixed method approach of integrating traditional methods with big-data analytics has enormous potential in the sub-discipline of digital sociology.},

More recently, campaigns for greater regional authority throughout Europe have represented a demand for opportunities to participate in decentralised, accessible polities. Based on data from 259 regions in Europe, we investigate whether political decentralisation and increased opportunities to participate are appropriate means of mitigating political inequality. The results not only fail to meet expectations but show that decentralisation in fact reinforces unequal voter turnout.

These unstructured graphs are not scattered in nature, but these show some relationships between their basic entities. Identifying communities based on these relationships improves the understanding of the applications represented by graphs. Community detection algorithms are one of the solutions which divide the graph into small size clusters where nodes are densely connected within the cluster and sparsely connected across. During the last decade, there are lots of algorithms proposed which can be categorized into mainly two broad categories; non-overlapping and overlapping community detection algorithm. The goal of this paper is to offer a comparative analysis of the various community detection algorithms. We bring together all the state of art community detection algorithms related to these two classes into a single article with their accessible benchmark data sets. Finally, we represent a comparison of these algorithms concerning two parameters: one is time efficiency, and the other is how accurately the communities are detected.},

In this work, we focus on the notion of political impartiality in multipartite political scenes. Our aim is to describe the graph-theoretic attributes of the ideal outlet that exhibits an impartial stance towards all political groups and propose a methodology based on Twitter, an OSN with profound informative and political profile, to algorithmically approximate this ideal medium and evaluate the deviation of popular outlets from it. The magnitude of deviation is used to rank the existing outlets based on their political impartiality and, hence, tackle the bewildering question: \emph{Which are the most impartial news media in a political scene?}. We utilize our techniques on a snapshot of the Twitter subgraph concerning the Greek political and news media scene in April 2018. The results of our approach are juxtaposed with the findings of a survey provided to a group of political scientists and the efficiency of our proposed methodology is soundly confirmed.},

Propriety refers to an individual evaluator's belief that a legitimacy object is appropriate for its social context, whereas validity denotes an institutionalized, collective-level perception of appropriateness. In this article, we refine this multi-level understanding of legitimacy by adding a third, meso-level construct of ``consensus'', which we define as the agreement between evaluators' propriety beliefs. Importantly, validity and consensus are distinct and can be incongruent, given that an institutionalized perception can hide underlying disagreement. Disentangling validity from consensus is a crucial extension of the multi-level theory of legitimacy, because it enables an improved understanding of the legitimacy processes that precede sudden and unanticipated institutional change. In particular, while previous works considered revised propriety beliefs as the starting point for institutional change, our account emphasizes that the disclosure of the actual (vs. merely assumed) belief distribution within a social context may instigate institutional change. To study the interplay of propriety, validity, and consensus empirically, we propose a set of experimental designs specifically geared towards improving knowledge of the role of legitimacy and its components in institutional change.},

  abstract = {Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are frequently used in epidemiology as a guide to assess causal inference assumptions. However, DAGs show the model as assumed, but not the assumption decisions themselves. We propose a framework which reveals these hidden assumptions, both conceptually and graphically. The DAGWOOD framework combines a root DAG (representing the DAG in the proposed analysis), a set of branch DAGs (representing alternative hidden assumptions to the root DAG), a graphical overlay (represents the branch DAGs over the root DAG), and a ruleset governing them. All branch DAGs follow the same rules for validity: they must 1) change the root DAG, 2) be a valid, identifiable causal DAG, and either 3a) require a change in the adjustment set to estimate the effect of interest, or 3b) change the number of frontdoor paths. The set of branch DAGs corresponds to a list of alternative assumptions, where all members of the assumption list must be justifiable as being negligible or non-existent. A graphical overlay helps show these alternative assumptions on top of the root DAG. We define two types of branch DAGs: exclusion restrictions and misdirection restrictions. Exclusion restrictions add a single- or bi-directional arc between two existing nodes in the root DAG (e.g. direct pathways and colliders), while misdirection restrictions represent alternative pathways that could be drawn between objects (e.g., reversing the direction of causation for a controlled confounder turning that variable into a collider). Together, these represent all single-change assumptions to the root DAG. The DAGWOOD framework 1) makes explicit and organizes important causal model assumptions, 2) reinforces best DAG practices, 3) provides a framework for critical evaluation of causal models, and 4) can be used in iterative processes for generating causal models.},

  abstract = {Understanding patterns of symptom co-occurrence is one of the most difficult challenges in psychopathology research. Do symptoms co-occur because of a latent factor, or might they directly and causally influence one another? Motivated by such questions, there has been a surge of interest in network analyses that emphasize the putatively direct role symptoms play in influencing each other. In this critical paper, we highlight conceptual and statistical problems with using centrality measures in cross-sectional networks. In particular, common network analyses assume that there are no unmodeled latent variables that confound symptom co-occurrence. The traditions of clinical taxonomy and test development in psychometric theory, however, greatly increase the possibility that latent variables exist in symptom data. In simulations that include latent variables, we demonstrate that closeness and betweenness are vulnerable to spurious covariance among symptoms that connect subgraphs (e.g., diagnoses). We further show that strength is redundant with factor loading in several cases. Finally, if a symptom reflects multiple latent causes, centrality metrics reflect a weighted combination, undermining their interpretability in empirical data. Our results suggest that it is essential for network psychometric approaches to examine the evidence for latent variables prior to analyzing or interpreting patterns at the symptom level. Failing to do so risks identifying spurious relationships or failing to detect causally important effects. Altogether, we argue that centrality measures do not provide solid ground for understanding the structure of psychopathology when latent confounding exists.},

States can be defined by the participation versus silence of individuals in conversations that surround key words, and we approximate the joint distribution of these binary variables using the maximum entropy principle, finding the least structured models that match the mean probability of individuals tweeting and their pairwise correlations. These models provide very accurate, quantitative descriptions of higher order structure in these social networks. The parameters of these models seem poised close to critical surfaces in the space of possible models, and we observe scaling behavior of the data under coarse-graining. These results suggest that simple models, grounded in statistical physics, may provide a useful point of view on the larger data sets now emerging from complex social systems.},

This downfall may be partially explained by the "water cooler effect", which holds that higher levels of social interaction lead to higher productivity due to a boost in people's mood. Somewhat paradoxically, however, there are reports of increased productivity in the remote working scenario. Here we address quantitatively this issue using an agent-based model to simulate a workplace with extrovert and introvert agent stereotypes that differ solely on their propensities to initiate a social interaction. We find that the effects of curtailing social interactions depend on the proportion of the stereotypes in the working group: while the social restriction measures always have a negative impact on the productivity of groups composed predominantly of introverts, they may actually improve the productivity of groups composed predominantly of extroverts, which offers then an explanation for the paradox of productivity during quarantine.},

While political scientists have devoted ample attention to democratic crises and dissatisfaction, this article suggests that citizens' frequent references to their ``frustration'' should be taken more literally. Specifically, it suggests that citizens become frustrated when a perceived democratic delivery deficit interacts with a strong democratic expectation or desire. The article tests this model using two original surveys run in the UK during the 2017 General Election and 2019 European Parliament elections. By measuring expectations and delivery deficit separately, the article maps democratic frustration vis-\`a-vis alternative concepts such as apathy, criticality, and cynicism, and shows that it is more widespread as an expectation\textendash deficit combination than any of them. It suggests that democratic frustration comprises of three dimensions: ideological, institutional and political. Adapting insights from the psychology of frustration that show it usually results in expressions of withdrawal, anger, or aggression, the article then explores how the three dimensions of frustration typically result in different pathologies. Ideological frustration leads to abstention (withdrawal), institutional frustration to peaceful demonstrations or radical vote (anger) and to envisage leaving one's country, whilst political and institutional frustrations combine and lead citizens to consider taking part in violent demonstrations or even joining a revolution (aggression).},

We refer to variances of item difficulties on the group level violating this assumption as random group differential item functioning (RG-DIF).

In a simulation study, the magnitude of RGDIF and the covariance of the item difficulties on the group level were varied. When group level effects were independent, all three methods performed well. With correlated DIF, estimated variances on the group level were biased with the full three-level GLMM and ML-LR. This bias was more pronounced for ML-LR than for the full three-level GLMM. Using a three-level GLMM with anchor items allowed unbiased estimation of RG-DIF.},

Moreover, we show that the expected distance between two networks independently sampled from a generative model is a useful property that encapsulates many key features of that model. To illustrate our results, we calculate this within-ensemble graph distance and related quantities for classic network models (and several parameterizations thereof) using 20 distance measures commonly used to compare graphs. The within-ensemble graph distance provides a new framework for developers of graph distances to better understand their creations and for practitioners to better choose an appropriate tool for their particular task.},

In many psychological applications, however, the Ising model is defined in the domain \$\textbackslash\{0,1\textbackslash\}\$ instead of the classical domain \$\textbackslash\{-1,1\textbackslash\}\$. While it is possible to transform the parameters of a given Ising model in one domain to obtain a statistically equivalent model in the other domain, the parameters in the two versions of the Ising model lend themselves to different interpretations and imply different dynamics, when studying the Ising model as a dynamical system. In this tutorial paper, we provide an accessible discussion of the interpretation of threshold and interaction parameters in the two domains and show how the dynamics of the Ising model depends on the choice of domain.

We first review the contemporary philosophy of science literature on scientific theories and argue that fully achieving the aims of explanation, prediction, and control requires that we construct formal theories of mental disorders: theories expressed in the language of mathematics or a computational programming language. We then investigate three routes by which one can use empirical findings (i.e., data models) to construct formal theories: (a) using data models themselves as formal theories, (b) using data models to infer formal theories, and (c) comparing empirical data models to theory-implied data models in order to evaluate and refine an existing formal theory. We argue that the third approach is the most promising path forward and conclude by expanding on this approach, proposing a framework for theory construction that details how to best use empirical research to generate, develop, and test formal theories of mental disorders.},

In this paper, we show that whether bias is present or not depends on which research question one aims to answer. We review five possible research questions one may have in mind when they separately estimate network models in groups that are based on sum-scores. For each research question we provide an illustration with a bivariate example and discuss the exact nature of the bias, if present. We show that if one is indeed interested in the network models of the groups defined by the sum-score, no bias is introduced. However, if one is interested in the network model in the general population, differences across groups defined by a variable other than the sum-score, detecting population heterogeneity, or inferring direct causal relations, then bias will be introduced in most situations. Finally, we discuss for each research question how bias can be avoided.},

In this article, we present a novel machine learning-based election forecasting model that predicted Pakistan's 2018 General Election with the highest accuracy and won a nation-wide competition. To capture the winning probability of individual candidates in a constituency, the model taped an array of statistics from different data sources. Past election data was employed to mine demographic trends of each party across the districts, Twitter, and approval polls were exploited to snap current popularity levels. By employing Bayesian optimization, the model combined the probabilities from different sources by 'rigging' the results for ten seats as a win, where competition was expected to be one-sided. In contrast to the existing models that only predict the aggregate share of votes for different political parties at the national level, our model also effectively predicted the winning candidates for every national assembly seat. The seat share of political parties in the national assembly was predicted with 83\% accuracy. Of the total 270 constituencies, 230 winners were among the top two candidates, predicted by the proposed technique. Our model produces the most accurate results of the election compared to all the opinion polls and surveys held before the election 2018 in the country.

  abstract = {We discuss formal, theoretical and practical issues with the statistical analysis of multivariate time series data that represent self-reports of human experience, often referred to as Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) data, or, Experience Sampling Method (ESM) data. We argue such time series likely violate the assumptions required for valid statistical inference, such as the memoryless-ness property (due to the presence of long-range temporal correlations) and ergodicity (due to non-stationarity and non-homogeneity of central moments). Moreover, we consider the common practice of interpreting outcomes of self-reports as if they were outcomes of classical physical measurements as extremely problematic and suggest to consider them as records of the temporal evolution of observables of a complex adaptive system with internal state dynamics. We propose to address some of these issues by analyzing the Change Profile instead of the observed time series, using recurrence-bases analyses, specifically, (multiplex) recurrence networks. We analyze a publicly available data set in which 4 participants rated 6 questions about their self-esteem and physical self, twice a day over a period of 512 days and introduce the concept of recurrence networks weighted by recurrence time. The edge weights represent either recurrence times or recurrence time frequencies and results show the scaling relation between vertex degree and vertex strength (the weighted variant of vertex degree), is associated to the scaling relation between frequency and spectral power based on the `raw' time series. In addition, we present a new spiral layout for recurrence networks that might be more appropriate when the detection of critical periods, regime shifts and tipping points requires insight in the temporal order in which those events occur. We conclude a complex systems approach to analyzing multivariate time series of self-reports of human experience is preferred over and above fitting statistical models like the Gaussian Graphical Model, or its derivatives.},

Thankfully, through experience, we learn norms and conventions that provide stable expectations for navigating our social world. Here, we review several distinct influences on their content and distribution. At the level of individuals locally interacting in dyads, success depends on rapidly adapting pre-existing norms to the local context. Hence, norms are shaped by complex cognitive processes involved in learning and social reasoning. At the population level, norms are influenced by intergenerational transmission and the structure of the social network. As human social connectivity continues to increase, understanding and predicting how these levels and time scales interact to produce new norms will be crucial for improving communities.{$<$}/p{$><$}/div{$>$}},

In this project, we aimed to clarify the associations between the three types of maladaptive social self-beliefs and fear and avoidance of social-evaluative situations in a nonclinical community sample (n = 389) to illuminate pathways at play in the development of social anxiety. We used network analysis to estimate functional relations among aspects of maladaptive self-beliefs, fear, and avoidance of social-evaluative situations. We computed two different network models, a graphical Gaussian model (GGM) and a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Each model estimates edges and the importance of nodes in different ways. Both GGM and DAG pointed to fear and conditional beliefs as especially potent pathways bridging maladaptive social self-beliefs and social anxiety in our nonclinical sample. Altogether, this novel network approach offers viable data-driven heuristics in the identification of pivotal theory-driven mechanisms of the instigation of interactions between maladaptive social self-beliefs and social anxiety.},

Following recent work by Landwehr and Steiner (2017), we distinguish four modes of decision-making embedded in different conceptions of democracy: trusteeship democracy, anti-pluralism, deliberative proceduralism, and majoritarianism. Drawing on data from Austria and Germany, we show that populism and radical host ideologies tap into different dimensions of democracy. While populism is primarily directed against representative forms of democratic decision-making, preferences for deliberative procedures and majority decisions appear entirely shaped by radical left and right host ideologies. Populism thus views decision-making based on the general will of the people as the only legitimate democratic procedure, whereas radical left and right host ideologies aim at involving the relevant group(s) of citizens. Further analyses of the interactions between populist attitudes and radical host ideologies confirm that the effects of populism remain robust and thus independent of the specific manifestations of radical host ideologies. These findings help to disentangle the causes of democratic discontent and to develop possible responses through democratic reforms that specifically and separately aim to mitigate populism and radical host ideologies.},

Traditional approaches to such evaluations have applied study designs and statistical models, which implicitly assume that change is linear, constant and caused by independent influences on behaviour (such as behaviour change techniques). This article illustrates limitations of these standard tools, and considers the benefits of adopting a complex adaptive systems approach to behaviour change research. It 1) outlines the complexity of behaviours and behaviour change interventions, 2) introduces readers to some key features of complex systems and how these relate to human behaviour change, and 3) provides suggestions for how researchers can better account for implications of complexity in analysing change mechanisms. We focus on three common features of complex systems (i.e. interconnectedness, non-ergodicity and non-linearity), and introduce Recurrence Analysis, a method for nonlinear time series analysis which is able to quantify complex dynamics. The supplemental website (https://git.io/Jffrm) provides exemplifying code and data for practical analysis applications. The complex adaptive systems approach can complement traditional investigations by opening up novel avenues for understanding and theorising about the dynamics of behaviour change.},

Techniques relying on the visual estimation of the strength of evidence have been recommended to limit such dichotomous interpretations but their effectiveness has been challenged. We ran two experiments to compare several representation alternatives of confidence intervals, and used Bayesian multilevel models to estimate the effects of the representation styles on differences in subjective confidence of the results and preferences in visualization styles. Our results suggest that adding visual information to classic CI representation can decrease the sudden drop around p-value 0.05 compared to classic CIs and textual representation of CI with p-values.

To solve this problem, we suggest a novel sampling method which takes community information into consideration. It first samples dense vertex sequences by taking advantage of modularity function and then learns vertex representation by using the Skip-gram model.

However, estimating a network model is not sufficient for determining which symptoms might be most effective to intervene upon, and is not sufficient for determining the potential efficacy of any given intervention. In this paper, we attempt to remedy this gap by introducing fundamental concepts in control theory to both methodologists and applied psychologists. We show how two controllability measures, average and modal controllability, can be used to select the best set of intervention targets. We provide a statistical testing procedure for determining if the dynamical systems of different people have the same optimal intervention targets. Following that, we show how intervention scientists can probe the effects of both theoretical and empirical interventions on networks derived from real data; demonstrate how simulations can be used to account for intervention cost and the desire to reduce specific symptoms; introduce a metric for evaluating intervention efficacy, the intervention efficacy ratio (IER); and showcase how between subject heterogeneity in intervention response can be evaluated. Every step is illustrated using rich clinical EMA data from a sample of subjects undergoing treatment for complicated grief, with a focus on the outcome `Suicidal Ideation'. All methods are implemented in an open-source R package ''netcontrol'', and complete code for replicating the analyses in this manuscript is available at https://osf.io/f268v/.},

  abstract = {In this article we analyze the effects of election salience on affective polarization. Campaigns and elections epitomize the moment of maximum political conflict, information spread, mobilization, and activation of political identities and predispositions. We therefore expect that affective polarization will be higher just after an election has taken place. By the same token, as elections lose salience, affective polarization will diminish. We analyze this question using CSES data from 99 post-electoral surveys conducted in 42 countries between 1996 and 2016. Our identification strategy exploits variation in the timing of survey interviews with respect to the election day as an exogenous measure of election salience. The empirical findings indicate that as elections lose salience affective polarization declines. The article further contributes to the debate on the origins of affective polarization by exploring two mechanisms that may account for this relationship: changes in ideological polarization and in the intensity of party identification. Both are relevant mediators, with ideological polarization seemingly playing a more important role.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}The explosion of activity in finding interactions in complex systems is driven by availability of copious observations of complex natural systems. However, such systems, e.g. the human brain, are rarely completely observable. Interaction network inference must then contend with hidden variables affecting the behavior of the observed parts of the system. We present a novel data-driven approach for model inference with hidden variables. From configurations of observed variables, we identify the observed-to-observed, hidden-to-observed, observed-to-hidden, and hidden-to-hidden interactions, the configurations of hidden variables, and the number of hidden variables. We demonstrate the performance of our method by simulating a kinetic Ising model, and show that our method outperforms existing methods. Turning to real data, we infer the hidden nodes in a neuronal network in the salamander retina and a stock market network. We show that predictive modeling with hidden variables is significantly more accurate than that without hidden variables. Finally, an important hidden variable problem is to find the number of clusters in a dataset. We apply our method to classify MNIST handwritten digits. We find that there are about 60 clusters which are roughly equally distributed amongst the digits. {$<$}/p{$>$}},

The desire to punish was reliably predicted by linear gradients of social closeness to both the perpetrator (negative relationship) and the victim (positive relationship). Older rather than younger adults, conservatives rather than people with other political orientations, and individuals high rather than low in moral identity desired to punish perpetrators more harshly. The desire to punish was related to state anger, disgust, and embarrassment, and these were linked to lower momentary well-being. However, the negative effect of these emotions on well-being was partially compensated by a positive indirect pathway via heightened feelings of moral self-worth. Implications of the present field data for moral punishment research and the connection between morality and well-being are discussed.},

Despite multiple approaches to dealing adequately with missing data, many scholars still fail to address this vital issue. In this article, we present a simple-to-use method for generating multiple imputations (MIs) using a Gaussian copula. The Gaussian copula for MI allows scholars to attain estimation results that have good coverage and small bias. The use of copulas to model the dependence among variables will enable researchers to construct valid joint distributions of the data, even without knowledge of the actual underlying marginal distributions. MIs are then generated by drawing observations from the resulting posterior joint distribution and replacing the missing values. Using simulated and observational data from published social science research, we compare imputation via Gaussian copulas with two other widely used imputation methods: multiple imputation via chained equations and Amelia II. Our results suggest that the Gaussian copula approach has a slightly smaller bias, higher coverage rates, and narrower confidence intervals compared to the other methods. This is especially true when the variables with missing data are not normally distributed. These results, combined with theoretical guarantees and ease of use, suggest that the approach examined provides an attractive alternative for applied researchers undertaking MIs.},

The aim of the present study was to explore how risk and protective factors for suicide interact with one another in a network sense, and to determine which factors were most central to a network of these factors. Method: Using an online survey, cross-sectional data was collected from a sample of 515 individuals who lived in New Zealand, Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America. Participants were recruited through either social media or Prolific Academic. A network of 18 risk and protective factors for suicide was estimated using network analysis. Analyses were preregistered on the Open Science Framework. Results: Factors that had the highest strength centrality were feeling depressed, feeling hopeless, perceived burdensomeness, self-esteem, and social support. Factors that were directly associated with suicidal ideation included feeling depressed, perceived burdensomeness, feeling hopeless, self-esteem, resilience, access to mental health services and a positive attitude towards these services. Conclusion: This research demonstrates the importance of examining protective factors as well as risk factors when determining an individual's suicide risk. The results suggest that interventions targeting depression may be particularly beneficial in reducing suicide risk, but further longitudinal research is required.},

Why? To the extent that social psychologists function as a moral tribal community (as Clark and Winegard argue), motivated to protect their professional and political interests, they will fight tooth and nail to defend their sacred values and professional statuses against charges of political bias. Regardless, in the rest of this paper we expand upon two of Clark and Winegard's (in press) arguments: 1. there are no reasons to believe that social scientists are immune to the biases, errors, and distortions that stem from tribal loyalties; 2. these tribal tendencies, combined with extreme ideological homogeneity, work to create significant problems for the pursuit of scientific truth.

  abstract = {Dynamic and temporal graphs are rich data structures that are used to model complex relationships between entities over time. In particular, anomaly detection in temporal graphs is crucial for many real world applications such as intrusion identification in network systems, detection of ecosystem disturbances and detection of epidemic outbreaks. In this paper, we focus on change point detection in dynamic graphs and address two main challenges associated with this problem: I) how to compare graph snapshots across time, II) how to capture temporal dependencies. To solve the above challenges, we propose Laplacian Anomaly Detection (LAD) which uses the spectrum of the Laplacian matrix of the graph structure at each snapshot to obtain low dimensional embeddings. LAD explicitly models short term and long term dependencies by applying two sliding windows. In synthetic experiments, LAD outperforms the state-of-the-art method. We also evaluate our method on three real dynamic networks: UCI message network, US senate co-sponsorship network and Canadian bill voting network. In all three datasets, we demonstrate that our method can more effectively identify anomalous time points according to significant real world events.},

In recent years, there's an increasing focus on the rapid development of more complicated networks, namely multilayer networks. Communities in a single-layer network are groups of nodes that are more strongly connected among themselves than the others, while in multilayer networks, a group of well-connected nodes are shared in multiple layers. Most traditional algorithms can rarely perform well on a multilayer network without modifications. Thus, in this paper, we offer overall comparisons of existing works and analyze several representative algorithms, providing a comprehensive understanding of community detection methods in multilayer networks. The comparison results indicate that the promoting of algorithm efficiency and the extending for general multilayer networks are also expected in the forthcoming studies.},

We find a simple and intuitive condition under which the posterior model distribution tends to be concentrated on the true model as the sample size increases even if the number of predictors grows much faster than the sample size does. Simulation study results indicate that satisfaction of this condition is essential for the success of Bayesian high-dimensional variable selection under the g-prior.},

We build on both, theoretical work and qualitative evaluations on the influence of populism on democratic quality. We follow Cas Mudde and Cristob\'al Rovira Kaltwasser's (2012) distinction between populism in government and populism in opposition. We expect populism in opposition to function as a corrective. That is to say, it acts as a ``drunken guest'' who blurts out painful truths (e. g. issues which are ignored by other parties or shortcomings of policy outputs). In government, however, it is likely to harm democratic quality since it does not respect the rules of public contestation (e. g. undermining the legitimacy of democratic institutions). Furthermore, we contend that the effect's size is moderated by the level of consolidation, and in the case of PRRPs in government, by the specific type of government.},

To bridge this gap, we propose a model of competing opinion diffusion on social networks taking into account degree-dependent fitness or persuasiveness. We study the combined influence of social networks, individual fitnesses and attributes, as well as mass media on people's opinions, and find that both social networks and mass media act as amplifiers in opinion diffusion, the amplifying effect of which can be quantitatively characterized. We analytically obtain the probability that each opinion will ultimately pervade the whole society when there are no committed people in networks, and the final proportion of each opinion at the steady state when there are committed people in networks. The results of numerical simulations show good agreement with those obtained through an analytical approach. This study provides insight into the collective influence of individual attributes, local social networks and global media on opinion diffusion, and contributes to a comprehensive understanding of competing diffusion behaviours in the real world.},

  abstract = {Bias in causal comparisons has a direct correspondence with distributional imbalance of covariates between treatment groups. Weighting strategies such as inverse propensity score weighting attempt to mitigate bias by either modeling the treatment assignment mechanism or balancing specified covariate moments. This paper introduces a new weighting method, called energy balancing, which instead aims to balance weighted covariate distributions. By directly targeting the root source of bias, the proposed weighting strategy can be flexibly utilized in a wide variety of causal analyses, including the estimation of average treatment effects and individualized treatment rules. Our energy balancing weights (EBW) approach has several advantages over existing weighting techniques. First, it offers a model-free and robust approach for obtaining covariate balance, obviating the need for modeling decisions of secondary nature to the scientific question at hand. Second, since this approach is based on a genuine measure of distributional balance, it provides a means for assessing the balance induced by a given set of weights. Finally, the proposed method is computationally efficient and has desirable theoretical guarantees under mild conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this EBW approach in a suite of simulation experiments and in a study on the safety of right heart catheterization.},

Next, we explore possible explanatory mechanisms by proposing how four levels of meaning associated with religion\textemdash cognitive, motivational, societal, and intergroup\textemdash may both promote and attenuate prejudice.

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Researchers who generate data often optimize efficiency and robustness by choosing stratified over simple random sampling designs. Yet, all theories of inference proposed to justify matching methods are based on simple random sampling. This is all the more troubling because, although these theories require exact matching, most matching applications resort to some form of ex post stratification (on a propensity score, distance metric, or the covariates) to find approximate matches, thus nullifying the statistical properties these theories are designed to ensure. Fortunately, the type of sampling used in a theory of inference is an axiom, rather than an assumption vulnerable to being proven wrong, and so we can replace simple with stratified sampling, so long as we can show, as we do here, that the implications of the theory are coherent and remain true. Properties of estimators based on this theory are much easier to understand and can be satisfied without the unattractive properties of existing theories, such as assumptions hidden in data analyses rather than stated up front, asymptotics, unfamiliar estimators, and complex variance calculations. Our theory of inference makes it possible for researchers to treat matching as a simple form of preprocessing to reduce model dependence, after which all the familiar inferential techniques and uncertainty calculations can be applied. This theory also allows binary, multicategory, and continuous treatment variables from the outset and straightforward extensions for imperfect treatment assignment and different versions of treatments.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

A popular practice among football fans in Brazil is to organize contests in which each participant informs guesses on the final score of each match. The participants are then ranked according to some scoring rule. Inspired by these contests, we created a website to hold an online contest, in which participants were asked for their probabilities on the outcomes of upcoming matches of the WCT. After each round of the tournament, the ranking of all users based on a proper scoring rule were published. This paper studies the performance of some methods intended to extract the wisdom of the crowds, which are aggregated forecasts that uses some or all of the forecasts available. The later methods are compared to simpler forecasting strategies as well as to statistical prediction models. Our findings corroborate the hypothesis that, at least for sporting events, the wisdom of the crowds offers a competitive forecasting strategy. Specifically, some of these strategies were able to achieve high scores in our contest.},

These patterns of dependencies often take a form of a complex network whose structure potentially affects how the resources produced in the system are efficiently shared among its components, which in turn decides network's survivability. Here we present a simple model that provides insight into this relationship between the network structure and survivability. We show that, as a combined effect of local sharing and finite lifetime of resources, many components in a complex system may die of lack of resources even when sufficient amount is available in the system. We also obtain a surprising result that although the scale-free networks exhibit a significantly higher survivability compared to their homogeneous counterparts, a vertex in the later has a better chance of survival for long. Finally, we demonstrate that the system's survivability can be substantially improved by changing the way vertices distribute resources among the neighbours. Our work is a first step towards understanding the relationship between intricate resource dependencies present in many real-world complex systems and their survivability.},

But others, from Max Weber to Samuel Huntington, have claimed that cultural values are an enduring and autonomous influence on society. We test the thesis that economic development is linked with systematic changes in basic values. Using data from the three waves of the World Values Surveys, which include 65 societies and 75 percent of the world's population, we find evidence of both massive cultural change and the persistence of distinctive cultural traditions. Economic development is associated with shifts away from absolute norms and values toward values that are increasingly rational, tolerant, trusting, and participatory. Cultural change, however, is path dependent. The broad cultural heritage of a society-Protestant, Roman Catholic, Orthodox, Confucian, or Communist-leaves an imprint on values that endures despite modernization. Moreover, the differences between the values held by members of different religions within given societies are much smaller than are cross-national differences. Once established, such cross-cultural differences become part of a national culture transmitted by educational institutions and mass media. We conclude with some proposed revisions of modernization theory.]},

Choice sets are implicitly assumed to be the same for all voters, and their composition             is left to researchers' discretion. This article aims to relax such assumptions by             presenting a model with a varying probability of inclusion in the choice set. We apply             the ``constrained choice conditional logistic regression'' to survey data from the 1989             parliamentary election in Norway to examine the effects of party identification of             voters and electoral viability and policy extremity of parties on individual voters'             choice set compositions. Further, we look into the effect of parties' policy positions             on their electoral fates under alternative assumptions about the composition of voters'             choice sets. We find that voters' choice set composition conditions both the effects             of their policy considerations on vote choice and those of parties' policy offerings             on their electoral fates.          {$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Purchasing decisions are increasingly based on reviews by fellow consumers which often consist of positive and negative evaluations about the product (i.e. valence-inconsistency). We tested how the vividness of these reviews affects individuals' attitude ambivalence towards the product and their strategies to cope with this ambivalence. We hypothesized that reading vivid and valence-inconsistent reviews would lead to increased awareness of opposing features of attitudes towards the product (i.e. increased simultaneous accessibility) as compared to reading less vivid valence-inconsistent reviews. If this is indeed the case, individuals should feel more conflicted towards the attitude object (i.e. increased subjective ambivalence) and should be motivated to reduce it by using ambivalence-coping strategies, specifically (a) processing additional information that is congruent with their initial attitude and (b) delaying their decision. These hypotheses were mostly supported across five experiments. The experiments included manipulations of valence-inconsistent information between reviews and within a review including three preregistered studies (Ns~=~247, 396, 701, 433, 313, respectively).},

For decades the American National Election Study (ANES) has overestimated voter turnout, though the causes of this persistent bias are poorly understood. The face-to-face component of the 2012 ANES produced a turnout estimate at least 13 points higher than the benchmark voting-eligible population turnout rate. We consider three explanations for this overestimate in the survey: nonresponse bias, over-reporting and the possibility that the ANES constitutes an inadvertent mobilization treatment. Analysis of turnout data supplied by voter file vendors allows the three phenomena to be measured for the first time in a single survey. We find that over-reporting is the largest contributor, responsible for six percentage points of the turnout overestimate, while nonresponse bias and mobilization account for an additional 4 and 3 percentage points, respectively.},

Extensive simulations in this literature and here show that CRSE seriously underestimate coefficient standard errors and their associated confidence intervals, particularly with a small number of clusters and when there is little within cluster variation in the explanatory variables. These same simulations show that a method developed here provides more reliable estimates of coefficient standard errors. They underestimate confidence intervals for tests of individual and sets of coefficients in extreme conditions, but by far less than do CRSE. Simulations also show that this method produces more accurate standard error and confidence interval estimates than bootstrapping, which is often recommended as an alternative to CRSE.},

Social network plays a crucial role in human life with the progression of technology. In the online social network, the responsibility of opinion leaders is also vital in information diffusion and promotion purposes. In this manuscript, we proposed a different Game theory-based Opinion Leader Detection (GOLD) algorithm to identify the group of users having the maximum synergy declared as the coalition of opinion leaders. For implementing purpose, we used the game theory approach in which all the users behave like a player, and a trustor\textendash trustee tree formed comprised coalitions based on trust and conditional probability. We proposed an inventive and distinctive solution to measures the individual payoff using the distance-based centrality parameter. We also computed the Shapley value for each user to identify the maximum marginal contribution and determined the maximum synergy of each coalition. The main advantage of the proposed approach is to strengthen the power of the coalition and produced the synergetic outcome. The proposed approach delivered around 90\% accuracy and decreased 37\% execution time. Therefore, it provides superior results regarding the accuracy, precision, time complexity, rate of convergence, and computational time with other SNA (Social Network Analysis) measures.},

DNTM uses pre-partitioned disjoint communities and then analyzes the neighbourhood distribution of boundary nodes in disjoint communities to detect overlapping communities. It is a form of seed-based global method since boundary nodes are considered as seeds and become the starting point for detecting overlapping communities. Threshold value for each boundary node is used as minimum influence by the neighbours of a node in order to determine its belongingness to any community. The effectiveness of the DNTM algorithm has been demonstrated by testing on fifteen real-world datasets and compared with seven overlapping community detection algorithms. DNTM outperforms comparable algorithms with 10 out of 15 datasets and gives comparable results for the remaining 5 datasets in terms of the extended modularity \textbackslash documentclass[12pt]\{minimal\} 				\textbackslash usepackage\{amsmath\} 				\textbackslash usepackage\{wasysym\}  				\textbackslash usepackage\{amsfonts\}  				\textbackslash usepackage\{amssymb\}  				\textbackslash usepackage\{amsbsy\} 				\textbackslash usepackage\{mathrsfs\} 				\textbackslash usepackage\{upgreek\} 				\textbackslash setlength\{\textbackslash oddsidemargin\}\{-69pt\} 				\textbackslash begin\{document\}\$\$Q\_\{ov\}\$\$\textbackslash end\{document\} measure.

Recent large-scale studies exploring personality differences across cultures share substantial methodological and psychometric shortcomings that render it difficult to differentiate between method and trait variance. One prominent example is the implicit assumption of cross-cultural measurement invariance in personality questionnaires. In the rare instances where measurement invariance across cultures was tested, scalar measurement invariance\textemdash which is required for unbiased mean-level comparisons of personality traits\textemdash did not hold. In this article, we present an item sampling procedure, ant colony optimization, which can be used to select item sets that satisfy multiple psychometric requirements including model fit, reliability, and measurement invariance. We constructed short scales of the IPIP-NEO-300 for a group of countries that are culturally similar (USA, Australia, Canada, and UK) as well as a group of countries with distinct cultures (USA, India, Singapore, and Sweden). In addition to examining factor mean differences across countries, we provide recommendations for cross-cultural research in general. From a methodological perspective, we demonstrate ant colony optimization's versatility and flexibility as an item sampling procedure to derive measurement invariant scales for cross-cultural research. \textcopyright{} 2020 The Authors.

  abstract = {Regressions and meta-regressions are widely used to estimate patterns and effect sizes in various disciplines. However, many biological and medical analyses use relatively low sample size (N), contributing to concerns on reproducibility. What is the minimum N to identify the most plausible data pattern using regressions? Statistical power analysis is often used to answer that question, but it has its own problems and logically should follow model selection to first identify the most plausible model. Here we make null, simple linear and quadratic data with different variances and effect sizes. We then sample and use information theoretic model selection to evaluate minimum N for regression models. We also evaluate the use of coefficient of determination (R2) for this purpose; it is widely used but not recommended. With very low variance, both false positives and false negatives occurred at N {$<$} 8, but data shape was always clearly identified at N {$\geq$} 8. With high variance, accurate inference was stable at N {$\geq$} 25. Those outcomes were consistent at different effect sizes. Akaike Information Criterion weights (AICc wi) were essential to clearly identify patterns (e.g., simple linear vs. null); R2 or adjusted R2 values were not useful. We conclude that a minimum N = 8 is informative given very little variance, but minimum N {$\geq$} 25 is required for more variance. Alternative models are better compared using information theory indices such as AIC but not R2 or adjusted R2. Insufficient N and R2-based model selection apparently contribute to confusion and low reproducibility in various disciplines. To avoid those problems, we recommend that research based on regressions or meta-regressions use N {$\geq$} 25.},

Unfortunately, the fundamental factors that drive the generation of social networks (i.e., the network topology and content) and community structures have not been well investigated. In this paper, according to the natural characteristics of social networks, we reveal that individual topics play a core role in community generation. If two individuals are in the same community and are interested in similar topics, it is more likely that a link will form between them. Otherwise, the probability of generating a link depends on the relationships between their communities and the topics they talk about. Based on the above observations, a novel generative community detection model is proposed that simulates the generation of the network topology and network content by considering individual topics. Moreover, our model utilizes a topic model to generate network content. The model is evaluated on two real-world datasets. The experimental results show that the community detection results outperform all the state-of-the-art baselines. In addition to accurate community detection results, we identify each individual topic distribution and the most popular users corresponding to different topics in each community.},

Many models have been proposed for constructing and calculating trust. However, two common shortcomings make them less practical, especially in large OSNs: the information used to construct trust is (1) usually too complicated to get or maintain, that is, it is resource consuming; and (2) usually subjective and changeable, which makes it vulnerable to vicious nodes. With those problems in mind, we focus on generating small trusted graphs for large OSNs, which can be used to make previous trust evaluation algorithms more efficient and practical. We show how to preprocess a social network (PSN) by developing a simple and practical user-domain-based trusted acquaintance chain discovery algorithm through using the small-world network characteristics of online social networks and taking advantage of ''weak ties''. Then, we present how to build a trust network (BTN) and generate a trusted graph (GTG) with the adjustable width breadth-first search algorithms. To validate the effectiveness of our work and to evaluate the quality of the generated trusted graph, we conduct many experiments with the real data set from Epinions.com.

In this article, we focus on graph-based trust evaluation models in OSNs, particularly in the computer science literature. We first summarize the features of OSNs and the properties of trust. Then we comparatively review two categories of graph-simplification-based and graph-analogy-based approaches and discuss their individual problems and challenges. We also analyze the common challenges of all graph-based models.

We use SCORE \textbackslash cite\{SCORE\} for community detection, and propose a new goodness-of-fit measure. Denote the goodness-of-fit statistic in step \$m\$ by \$\textbackslash psi\_n\^\{(m)\}\$. We show that as \$n \textbackslash rightarrow \textbackslash infty\$, \$\textbackslash psi\_n\^\{(m)\} \textbackslash rightarrow N(0,1)\$ when \$m = K\$ and \$\textbackslash psi\_n\^\{(m)\} \textbackslash rightarrow \textbackslash infty\$ in probability when \$m {$<$} K\$. Therefore, with a proper threshold, StGoF terminates at \$m = K\$ as desired. We consider a broad setting where we allow severe degree heterogeneity, a wide range of sparsity, and especially weak signals. In particular, we propose a measure for signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and show that there is a phase transition: when \$\textbackslash mathrm\{SNR\} \textbackslash rightarrow 0\$ as \$n \textbackslash rightarrow \textbackslash infty\$, consistent estimates for \$K\$ do not exist, and when \$\textbackslash mathrm\{SNR\} \textbackslash rightarrow \textbackslash infty\$, StGoF is consistent, uniformly for a broad class of settings. In this sense, StGoF achieves the optimal phase transition. Stepwise testing algorithms of similar kind (e.g., \textbackslash cite\{wang2017likelihood, ma2018determining\}) are known to face analytical challenges. We overcome the challenges by using a different design in the stepwise algorithm and by deriving sharp results in the under-fitting case \$(m {$<$} K)\$ and the null case (\$m = K\$). The key to our analysis is to show that SCORE has the \{\textbackslash it Non-Splitting Property (NSP)\}. The NSP is non-obvious, so additional to rigorous proofs, we also provide an intuitive explanation.},

For instance, researchers may be tempted to conclude that nodes that appear close together are highly related, and that nodes that are far apart are less related. Yet this is not always the case. In networks plotted with force-directed algorithms, the most popular approach, the spatial arrangement of nodes is not easily interpretable. However, other plotting approaches can render node positioning interpretable. We provide a brief tutorial on several methods including multidimensional scaling, principal components plotting, and eigenmodel networks. We compare the strengths and weaknesses of each method, noting how to properly interpret each type of plotting approach.},

The results show that people with weaker belief synchronization are more likely to have smaller important-matter discussion networks.

This article describes a method for trust network analysis using subjective logic (TNA-SL). It provides a simple notation for expressing transitive trust relationships, and defines a method for simplifying complex trust networks so that they can be expressed in a concise form and be computationally analysed. Trust measures are expressed as beliefs, and subjective logic is used to compute trust between arbitrary parties in the network.

  author = {Juhl, Sebastian},
  doi = {10.1017/pan.2018.35},
  abstract = {According to spatial models of political competition, parties strategically adjust their ideological positions to movements made by rival parties. Spatial econometric techniques have been proposed to empirically model such interdependencies and to closely convert theoretical expectations into statistical models. Yet, these models often ignore that the parties' ideological positions are latent variables and, as such, accompanied by a quantifiable amount of uncertainty. As a result, the implausible assumption of perfectly measured covariates impedes a proper evaluation of theoretical propositions. In order to bridge this gap between theory and empirics, the present work combines a spatial econometric model and a Bayesian dynamic item response model. The proposed model accurately accounts for measurement uncertainty and simultaneously estimates the parties' ideological positions and their spatial interdependencies. To verify the model's utility, I apply it to recorded votes from the sixteen German state legislatures in the period from 1988 to 2016. While exhibiting a notable degree of ideological mobility, the results indicate only moderate spatial dependencies among parties of the same party family. More importantly, the analysis illustrates how measurement uncertainty can lead to substantively different results which stresses the importance of appropriately incorporating theoretical expectations into statistical models.},

However, the necessity to specify the underlying network of dependencies, denoted by~ W\textbackslash boldsymbol\{W\} , prior to estimation is a prevalent source of criticism since the true dependence structure is rarely known and theories mostly provide insufficient guidance. The present study investigates the effects of this network uncertainty which is a special case of model uncertainty that arises from uncertainty about the correct specification of~ W\textbackslash boldsymbol\{W\} . It advocates Bayesian model averaging (BMA) as a superior approach to this problem, located at the intersection of theory and empirics. Conducting Monte Carlo experiments, I demonstrate that, while the effect estimates are robust toward a misspecification in the functional form of~ W\textbackslash boldsymbol\{W\} , uncertainty in the neighborhood definition can bias the effect estimates derived from spatial autoregressive models. In contrast to alternative techniques, BMA directly addresses network uncertainty, correctly identifies the true network structure in the set of feasible alternatives, and provides unbiased effect estimates. Two replication studies from different subfields of the discipline illustrate the benefits of this approach for applied research.},

Whereas such and similar cases have been discussed within specific branches of scholarships, the attempts to propose and test a general theory of self-destruction in complex systems remain, to our knowledge, a thing of the future. To move in this direction, we suggest that the conflicts between explicit stratification, thorough functional differentiation and tacit segmentation within complex systems, are likely to provoke their unintended self-annihilation. Furthermore, we hypothesize that whenever such systems collapse, it is the circular co-dependency of noisy signaling, redundancy, and semantic inflation that sets self-destructive mechanisms in motion. We illustrate our preliminary findings with examples from social, natural, and artificial life; reexamine autoimmunity as a popular model of systemic self-destruction; and indicate potential avenues of empirical research aimed at supporting, qualifying or disproving the underlying hypothesis.},

The aim of this study was to examine the psychometric properties of the Disgust Scale\textemdash Revised (DS-R), a tool designed to measure individuals' responses to various disgust-provoking situations, among Korean populations. Methods A sample of 1117 healthy volunteers completed self-report questionnaires containing the 27-item DS-R. A subsample (n = 231) completed the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI), Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQ), and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Principal component analysis using a varimax rotation was conducted. Construct validity was assessed using Pearson correlation analysis for the TCI, EPQ, and STAI. To examine differences in responses on the DS-R among populations, patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder were compared with healthy subjects who were matched with respect to age and sex. Results The Cronbach {$\alpha$} estimates for total items and the 3 original subscales of the DS-R, including: core disgust, animal reminder disgust, and contamination-based disgust, were 0.86, 0.77, 0.80, and 0.55, respectively. Principal component analysis identified 5 factors, which accounted for 48\% of the total variance of the scale. The 5 newly developed dimensions were labeled as core disgust-touch, core disgust-dirt, contamination-based disgust, animal reminder disgust, and social intolerance disgust. The Cronbach {$\alpha$} coefficients were 0.79, 0.64, 0.46, 0.77, and 0.34, respectively, for these subscales. The DS-R was correlated positively with harm avoidance from the TCI, neuroticism from the EPQ, and the anxiety scores of STAI. Furthermore, the contamination-based disgust scores for patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder were higher than those of normal controls. Conclusion The DS-R may be a reliable, valid, and acceptable tool to measure disgust sensitivity among Korean populations. The psychometric properties of the Korean version of the DS-R and the original DS-R are discussed.},

  abstract = {In memory of Dr. Dennis John McFarland, who passed away recently, our objective is to continue his efforts to compare psychometric networks and latent variable models statistically. We do so by providing a commentary on his latest work, which he encouraged us to write, shortly before his death.

First, the interaction that only considers dynamic role for links or relationships (Heider balance), and second, the interaction that considers both individual opinions (nodes) and relationships in network dynamics (coevolutionary balance). The question is, as the temperature varies, which is a measure of social disorder, how structural balance can be created or destroyed by each of these triplet interactions? We use statistical mechanics methods and observe through analytical calculation and numerical simulation that unlike the Heider balance triplet interaction which has a discrete phase transition, the coevolutionary balance has a continuous phase transition. The critical temperature of the presented model change with the root square of network size which is a linear dependence in thermal Heider balance.},

Although political behavior in its full sense encompasses a very broad subject, in this intervention, I focus primarily on the electoral behavior of ordinary citizens. As for ``the era of Trump,'' my position is that rise of Trump, along with the Brexit vote, and the rise of European populism are very much of a piece\textemdash a modern democratic phenomenon rather than a specifically American one. Rather than requiring a fundamentally new approach in how we think about voters, however, they are all the heightened result of things that have been true for a long time, perhaps catalyzed, but not fundamentally caused, by current events. Moreover, these are things that used to be at the core of our teaching and research about electoral behavior, but have largely fallen off the agenda\textemdash and need to be brought back to a central position. This contribution is organized under three major headings: (1) how the content of what we teach about political/electoral behavior might be adjusted in the age of Trump; (2) how teaching about politics more generally might be changed in the age of Trump; (3) and the implications of what we are teaching for democracy, and for our role as both critics of, and propagandists for, liberal democracy.},

We then discuss how agent-based models can be created in Mesa. This is followed by a discussion of applications and extensions by other researchers to demonstrate how Mesa design is decoupled and extensible and thus creating the opportunity for a larger decentralized ecosystem of packages that people can share and reuse for their own needs. Finally, the paper concludes with a summary and discussion of future development areas for Mesa.},

Duodenogastric reflux was assessed both by a radiological technique and by measuring the concentration of bilirubin in the gastric aspirate before and after operation. Incidence and severity of postoperative gastritis were determined by endoscopic biopsy. Symptoms were assessed by symptomatic score and Visick grading. There was a significant correlation between duodenal reflux and histological evidence of both severe superficial gastritis and glandular atrophy (P less than 0-01). There was also a close association between the degree of reflux and the presence of severe heartburn, epigastric pain and bile vomiting after operation. The amount of reflux did not differ before operation. There was significantly less reflux following PGV than after either TV+P (P less than 0-025) or TV+A (P less than 0-001). The results indicate that an operation which preserves an innervated and intact antrum and pylorus will protect against postoperative duodenogastric reflux, gastritis and symptoms.},

A systematic analysis of this information can provide valuable insights into the structure and properties of these entities and the relations between them. Network science can be applied as a scientific framework for understanding the structure of such relational, heterogeneous datasets at scale. In this article, we use an existing, relational version of the Panama Papers to selectively construct various networks, and then study the properties of the underlying system using well-defined analytical methods from network science, including degree properties, country assortativity analyses, connectivity and single-point network metrics like transitivity and density. We also illustrate significant structural features in these networks by conducting a triad census and exploring the networks' core-periphery structure. Together, these results are used to show that the Panama Papers constitute a distinct class of networks that differ significantly from ordinary social and information networks. We also propose, construct and analyze `higher-order' networks from the raw data, such as a `social' network of officers. We confirm that some of these higher-order networks also show significant non-random deviations from expected or typical behavior, including in their degree distributions.},

In biological systems, scaling laws can reflect adaptive processes of various types and are often linked to complex systems poised near critical points. The same is true for perception, memory, language and other cognitive phenomena. Findings of scaling laws in cognitive science are indicative of scaling invariance in cognitive mechanisms and multiplicative interactions among interdependent components of cognition.},

That this point (i.e., ``fractal = nonlinear'') is incorrect remains novel to many readers. We suspect that unfamiliarity with autocorrelation has helped eclipse the linearity of fractal structure from more popular appreciation. In this article, in order to explain the linear nature of monofractality and its difference from multifractality, we present an introduction to the autocorrelation function and review short-lag memory, nonstationary motions, and the intermediary set of fractionally integrated processes that conventional fractal analyses quantify. Understanding from our own experiences how surprising the linearity of fractals is to accept, we attempt to make our points clear with as much graphic depiction as math. We hope to share our own experiences in struggling with this potentially strange-sounding idea that, really, monofractals are linear while at the same time contrasting them to multifractals that can indicate nonlinearity.},

  abstract = {Interactivity is a central theme of ecological psychology. According to Gibsonian views, behavior is the emergent property of interactions between organism and environment. Hence, an important challenge for ecological psychology has been to identify physical principles that provide an empirical window into interactivity. We suspect that multifractality, a concept from statistical physics, may be helpful in this regard, and we offer this article as a tutorial on multifractality with 2 main goals. First, we aim to describe multifractality with a series of simple, concrete, but progressively more elaborate examples that will incrementally elucidate the relationship between multifractality and interactivity. Second, we aim to describe a direct estimation method for computing the multifractal spectrum (e.g., Chhabra \& Jensen, 1989), presenting it as an alternative that avoids the pitfalls of more popular methods and that may address more appropriately the measurements traditionally taken by ecological psychologists. In sum, this tutorial aims to unpack the theoretical background for an analytical method allowing rigorous test of interactivity in a variety of empirical settings.},

While it is often used in moral psychology as an intermediary between researcher and participant, much of the human experience that occurs through language \textemdash{} our relationships, conversations, and, in general, the everyday transmission of our thoughts \textemdash has yet to be studied in association with moral concerns. In order to understand how moral concerns relate to observed language usage, we paired Facebook status updates (N = 107,798) from English-speaking participants (n = 2,691) with their responses on the Moral Foundations Questionnaire, which measures Care, Fairness, Loyalty, Authority, and Purity concerns. Overall, we found consistent evidence that participants' self-reported moral concerns can be predicted from their language, though the magnitude of this effect varied considerably among concerns. Across a diverse selection of Natural Language Processing methods, cross-validated R2 values ranged from 0.04 for predicting Fairness concerns to 0.21 for predicting Purity concerns. In follow-up analyses, each moral concern was found to be related to distinct patterns of relational, emotional, and social language. Our results are the first finding relating internally valid measures of moral concerns to observations of language, motivating several new avenues for exploring and investigating how the moral domain intersects with language usage.},

Simultaneously, given the current political and media climate and debates about `fake news', this article asks to what extent misinformation, i.e. the possession of erroneous political information, stimulates populist party support. Survey data from nine European democracies are used to assess to what extent populist party supporters differ from abstainers and non-populist party supporters in terms of their political information and misinformation. It is found that holding correct political information relates positively to the likelihood of turning out, whether it is to support populist or non-populist parties. It is further found that political misinformation relates positively to support for right-wing populist parties. The findings provide a first empirical and comparative contribution to recent debates that seek to connect misinformation and political behaviour.},

The presence of zealots can remove the unimodal and bimodal phases in the model with two opinion states. Here, we study the effects of zealots in noisy voter models with M{$>$}2 opinion states on complete interaction graphs. We find that the phase behaviour diversifies, with up to six possible qualitatively different types of stationary states. The presence of zealots removes some of these phases, but not all. We analyse situations in which zealots affect the entire population, or only a fraction of agents, and show that this situation corresponds to a single-community model with a fractional number of zealots, further enriching the phase diagram. Our study is conducted analytically based on effective birth-death dynamics for the number of individuals holding a given opinion. Results are confirmed in numerical simulations.},

Microblogging platforms like Twitter and Weibo are widely used by many politicians who have a huge number of followers and supporters on those platforms. It is essential to study the supporters' network of political leaders because it can help in decision making when predicting their political futures. This study focuses on the supporters' network of three famous political leaders of Pakistan, namely, Imran Khan (IK), Maryam Nawaz Sharif (MNS), and Bilawal Bhutto Zardari (BBZ). This is done using social network analysis and semantic analysis. The proposed method (1) detects and removes fake supporter(s), (2) mines communities in the politicians' social network(s), (3) investigates the supporters' reply network for conversations between supporters about each leader, and, finally, (4) analyses the retweet network for information diffusion of each political leader. Furthermore, sentiment analysis of the supporters of politicians is done using machine learning techniques, which ultimately predicted and revealed the strongest supporter network(s) among the three political leaders. Analysis of this data reveals that as of October 2017 (1) IK was the most renowned of the three politicians and had the strongest supporter's community while using Twitter in a very controlled manner, (2) BBZ had the weakest supporters' network on Twitter, and (3) the supporters of the political leaders in Pakistan are flexible on Twitter, communicating with each other, and that any group of supporters has a low level of isolation.},

  abstract = {Community detection is one of the most appealing research fields in computer science. Although many different methods have been proposed to cluster the nodes of a graph, none of these methods is complete. Each method has strengths and weaknesses in extracting highly coherent groups of nodes (i.e. communities or clusters). The differences that various methods show are typically due to two main factors: 1) structure of the network they operate on, and 2) the strategy they use to find clusters. Since none of these methods is optimal, it seems a good idea to combine them to take advantage of their strengths while minimizing their weaknesses. In this paper, we present a new approach for the community detection problem by considering an ensemble of community detection methods. We refer to our approach as ``Mitra''. The base methods employed in Mitra, use different techniques and strategies to find communities for different applications of network data analysis. Mitra employs some known base community detection methods, receives their results on a network and builds a bipartite network to combine the communities found by the base methods. Then the fast projection technique compresses and summarizes the bipartite network to a new unipartite one. Then we find the communities of the unipartite network in the final step. We evaluate our approach against real and artificial datasets and compare our method with each one of the base methods. Artificial datasets include a diverse collection of large scale benchmark graphs. In this work, the main experimental evaluation function is Normalized Mutual Information (NMI). We also use several measures to compare the quality and properties of final community structures of the partitions found by all methods.},

This is the idea behind consensus clustering technique which combines several clustering results into one. In this paper, we propose a very good-performing method based on consensus clustering to detect communities of a network. Our method, called Azar, employed several community detection methods as base methods. Then Azar generates a new compressed network based on the common views of the used base methods and, gives this new compressed network to the last community detection method to find the final partition. We evaluate our approach by employing real and artificial datasets. The implementation results compare the base methods with Azar according to accuracy measures such as modularity and Normalized Mutual Information (NMI). The results show the good-performing behavior of Azar even for the most difficult networks. The results show the brilliant power of Azar in comparison with all the other methods.},

The manipulated conditions for the simulation analysis were the analysis method, the number of groups, group size, and intraclass correlation. The results showed that, for samples consisting of a large number of groups, a large average group size and a large intraclass correlation, LMS had the strongest performance.

This article develops graphical models and graph-based arguments to show that gain score methods are a viable strategy for identifying causal treatment effects in observational studies. The proposed graphical models reveal that gain score methods rely on a bias-removing mechanism that is quite different to regular matching or covariance adjustment. While gain score methods offset noncausal associations via differencing, matching or covariance adjustment blocks noncausal association via conditioning. Since gain score estimators do not rely on conditioning, they are immune to measurement error in the pretest, bias amplification, and collider bias. The graph-based arguments also demonstrate that the key identifying assumption for gain score methods, the common trend assumption, is difficult to assess and justify when the pretest causally affects treatment assignment. Finally, we discuss the distinct role of pretests in the context of Lord's paradox.},

  abstract = {Due to its wide reaching implications for everything from identifying hot spots of income inequality to political redistricting, there is a rich body of literature across the sciences quantifying spatial patterns in socioeconomic data. In particular, the variability of indicators relevant to social and economic well-being between localized populations is of great interest, as it pertains to the spatial manifestations of inequality and segregation. However, heterogeneity in population density, sensitivity of statistical analyses to spatial aggregation, and the importance of predrawn political boundaries for policy intervention may decrease the efficacy and relevance of existing methods for analyzing spatial socioeconomic data. Additionally, these measures commonly lack either a framework for comparing results for qualitative and quantitative data on the same scale, or a mechanism for generalization to multiregion correlations. To mitigate these issues associated with traditional spatial measures, here we view local deviations in socioeconomic variables from a topological lens rather than a spatial one, and use an information theoretic network approach based on the generalized Jensen-Shannon divergence to distinguish distributional quantities across adjacent regions. We apply our methodology in a series of experiments to study the network of neighboring census tracts in the continental US, quantifying the decay in two-point distributional correlations across the network, examining the county-level socioeconomic disparities induced from the aggregation of tracts, and constructing an algorithm for the division of a city into homogeneous clusters. These results provide a framework for analyzing the variation of attributes across regional populations and shed light on universal patterns in socioeconomic attributes.},

  abstract = {Recently it has been argued that entropy can be a direct measure of complexity, where the smaller value of entropy indicates lower system complexity, while its larger value indicates higher system complexity. We dispute this view and propose a universal measure of complexity based on the Gell-Mann's view of complexity. Our universal measure of complexity bases on a non-linear transformation of time-dependent entropy, where the system state with the highest complexity is the most distant from all the states of the system of lesser or no complexity. We have shown that the most complex is optimally mixed states consisting of pure states i.e., of the most regular and most disordered which the space of states of a given system allows. A parsimonious paradigmatic example of the simplest system with a small and a large number of degrees of freedom, is shown to support this methodology. Several important features of this universal measure are pointed out, especially its flexibility (i.e., its openness to extensions), ability to the analysis of a system critical behavior, and ability to study the dynamic complexity.},

  abstract = {In recent environmental research, relational values (RVs) have emerged as a new group of values to explain environmental behavior. Although this new concept is attracting attention, empirical studies on the subject are still rare. On this basis, we have conducted three studies to analyze an existing measurement tool for RVs and compared the construct with the concept of connection to nature. In study 1, we confirmed convergent and discriminant validity of the RV scale by comparing it with the Two Factor Model of Environmental Values (2-MEV) model using a sample of n = 350 university students. Additionally, study 1 verified reliability using test\textendash retest reliability on three different groups of students (n1 = 53; n2 = 37; n3 = 48). In study 2, principal component analyses were performed to examine the structure of RVs and to compare it to the concept of connection to nature by reusing the sample 350 university students from study 1. The results show that RVs and connection to nature are not fundamentally distinct constructs, but overlap. However, if the structure of the RV measurement is forced to a single factor, no perfect fit is found, making a multidimensional solution more likely. A third study was conducted to review the results from study 2 using confirmatory factor analysis on a new sample of 878 university and high school students. Study 3 confirmed RVs as a multidimensional construct with three factors: care, community, and connection. It also proved the overlap of the connection to nature and RV concepts to some extent.},

  abstract = {Schwartz's theory of human values, as operationalized using different instruments such as the Portrait Values Questionnaire and the European Social Survey, was confirmed by multiple studies using Smallest Space Analysis (SSA). However, initial tests based on Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) pointed to low discriminant validity of the 10 basic values. Our hypothesis is that this is not an intrinsic characteristic of the values studied, but rather the result of the selection strategy of items that maximizes theoretical coverage but pays less attention to the homogeneity of items. This hypothesis is confirmed for the Portrait Values Questionnaire in multiple tests with data from two samples. Consequently, we propose an alternative structure that consists of 15 more specific values: Tradition, Humility, Self-restraint, Norm- following, Societal security, Power, Achieving goals, Achieving recognition, Hedonism, Autonomy of action, Autonomy of thought, Stimulation, Social equality, Preservation of nature, and Benevolence. The proposal respects the conceptual complexity of the values theory and the circular structure that orders the values, but avoids contamination of composite scores and increases their predictive power. Implications for further development of the scale are drawn.},

  pages = {13},
  abstract = {This paper addresses the question if it is meaningful to group basic values from the values model of Schwartz, which is a vital component of the European Social Survey (ESS), and presents an alternative approach. The suggestion to group values is raised in several studies led by Eldad Davidov, which more precisely conclude that only four of the original ten values can be studied as such (Hedonism, Stimulation, Self-direction, and Security), whereas the remaining six values have to be grouped in three pairs in order to solve the problem of a lack of discriminant validity. This paper indicates that the grouping was necessary because of the choice strategy of items for the ESS. The items chosen for the different values are chosen in such a way that the correlation within the value is relatively low and sometimes the correlations with items of other values is higher. We show this in three steps: the first one based on a German-study, looking for the correlation between the values in the original Portrait Values Questionnaire (PVQ). Secondly, the ESS selection from this wider set of items is used to show that this choice leads to much higher correlations between the values. Thirdly, an analysis with an alternative choice from the same PVQ set of items is done to show that this high correlation is not necessary. In this way we show that the high correlation between the values in the ESS is due to the selection of the items in the ESS and is not intrinsic to the values studied.},

We fill this gap by complementing the existing theory-driven approaches with a data-driven approach that allows an estimation of the spontaneously employed dimensions of stereotyping. Seven studies (total N = 4,451) show that people organize social groups primarily based on their agency/socioeconomic success (A), and as a second dimension, based on their conservative\textendash progressive beliefs (B). Communion (C) is not found as a dimension by its own, but rather as an emergent quality in the two-dimensional space of A and B, resulting in a 2D ABC model of stereotype content about social groups.

However, it is often difficult to distinguish between the true variables that form the latent components and the false variables that do not, especially when the association between the true variables and the exogenous set is weak. To overcome this limitation, we propose a Sparse Extended Redundancy Analysis via the Exclusive LASSO that performs variable selection while maintaining model specification. We validate the performance of the proposed approach in a simulation study. Finally, the empirical utility of this approach is demonstrated through two examples\textemdash one on a study of youth academic achievement and the other on a text analysis of newspaper data.},

Research on education systems as carriers of modern orientations and democratic values worldwide predicts that educated individuals will exhibit more democratic values than less educated ones, regardless of the country's level of democracy. In the political culture approach, political trust can be understood as a reflection of the congruence or incongruence between individual democratic values and the level of democracy of the political system, which emphasizes trust's relational character. Integrating these strands of literature, I formulate hypotheses about the mediating effect of democratic values between education and political trust. To test these hypotheses, I employ multilevel models of data from the World Values Survey and the European Values Study covering 73 countries. The results show that democratic values partially mediate the effect of education on political trust, but the magnitude of this effect depends on the level of democracy. Analyses also show that, while education is positively associated with democratic values regardless of the country's level of democracy, this association is much stronger in democratic countries than in non-democratic ones.},

Based on the unified model, most existing diffusion models can be reconstructed and implemented easily by setting influence and diffusion functions. In this paper, we use this model reconstructed five traditional models and we evaluate the model with a real collected dataset of 2.2 million blogs and the results show that the unified model can be adopted easily to fulfill classic diffusion models. Furthermore, the model sheds light on designing novel explainable information model in the future.},

The outcome variable is assumed to be a binomial proportion, as is commonly encountered in observational and archival research. The approach draws on principles of multilevel modeling to implement random intercepts and slopes that vary among dyads. The corresponding variance function permits the computation of a dyadic reciprocity correlation.

Our main research involves the process of opinion formation and finding phases of the system in terms of parameters describing noise and flow of the information for two and three opinions available in the system. The results show that opinion formation and spread are influenced by both (i) flow of information among actors (effective range of interactions among actors) and (ii) noise (randomness in adopting opinions). The noise not only leads to opinions disorder but also it promotes consensus under certain conditions. In disordered phase and when the exchange of information is spatially effectively limited, various faces of disorder are observed, including system states, where the signatures of self-organised criticality manifest themselves as scale-free probability distribution function of cluster sizes. Then increase of noise level leads system to disordered random state. The critical noise level above which histograms of opinion clusters' sizes loose their scale-free character increases with increase of the easy of information flow.},

We have observed that moderate users have a tendency to follow the average opinion of their online friends, which we interpret as a presence of bounded confidence. Further, we have discovered that the probability of moving toward the average opinion goes down if the difference between it and the user's opinion is too large. Another interesting feature uncovered is that if a user's opinion and the average opinion of their online friends are very similar, the influence also decreases.},

Our analysis has revealed traces of both positive (assimilative) and negative (repulsive) influence in how users decide whether to change their opinions, while magnitudes of changed opinions appear to obey a positive influence. We also found that individuals with networks that include many ideologically opposite users are less prone to radicalization than those with homogenous ones.

Here, we propose that individuals are aggregates that preserve a measure of temporal integrity, i.e., ``propagate'' information from their past into their futures. We formalize this idea using information theory and graphical models. This mathematical formulation yields three principled and distinct forms of individuality\textemdash an organismal, a colonial, and a driven form\textemdash each of which varies in the degree of environmental dependence and inherited information. This approach can be thought of as a Gestalt approach to evolution where selection makes figure-ground (agent\textendash environment) distinctions using suitable information-theoretic lenses. A benefit of the approach is that it expands the scope of allowable individuals to include adaptive aggregations in systems that are multi-scale, highly distributed, and do not necessarily have physical boundaries such as cell walls or clonal somatic tissue. Such individuals might be visible to selection but hard to detect by observers without suitable measurement principles. The information theory of individuality allows for the identification of individuals at all levels of organization from molecular to cultural and provides a basis for testing assumptions about the natural scales of a system and argues for the importance of uncertainty reduction through coarse-graining in adaptive systems.},

Multiple imputation using sophisticated imputation models based on exponential random graph models (ERGMs) lead to acceptable biases in descriptive statistics and model parameters even under large amounts of missing data. For link reconstruction multiple imputation by simple ERGM performed well on small data sets, while missing data was more accurately imputed in larger data sets with multiple imputation by complex Bayesian ERGMs (BERGMs).},

Integrating theories on changing socio-political conflict with arguments about crises of political representation, we contend that electoral support for radical right and radical left parties is rooted in two distinct sets of socio-structural factors, but their translation into electoral choice is in both cases conditioned by the individual political discontent that originates in specific political dynamics. Relying on the European Social Survey (ESS) covering the period from 2002 to 2016 and Parlgov data, we show that the lack of responsiveness of mainstream parties to the changing social conflict structure provides critical opportunities for new challengers from both the radical left and the radical right, while voters' political discontent only works to heighten their success when these parties are in opposition. Our article contributes not only by offering an integrative account of the electoral appeal of the radical right and radical left parties. In emphasising the largely similar nature of short-term, political factors that condition the translation of the different sets of long-term, structural determinants into opting for these parties, critically, this article also contributes to understanding the electoral success of radical challengers across western Europe.},

Instead, we should consider the three main inference modes--experimental approaches and the counterfactual theory, large-N observational studies, and qualitative process-tracing--as observable indicators of an unobserved latent construct, causality. Under ideal conditions, any of these three approaches provide strong, though not perfect, evidence of an important part of what we mean by causality. I also present the use of statistical entropy, or information theory, as a possible yardstick for evaluating research designs across the silver standards. Rather than dichotomize studies as either causal or descriptive, the concept of relative entropy instead emphasizes the relative causal knowledge gained from a given research finding.},

  abstract = {Critical transitions occur in a wide variety of applications including mathematical biology, climate change, human physiology and economics. Therefore it is highly desirable to find early-warning signs. We show that it is possible to classify critical transitions by using bifurcation theory and normal forms in the singular limit. Based on this elementary classification, we analyze stochastic fluctuations and calculate scaling laws of the variance of stochastic sample paths near critical transitions for fast-subsystem bifurcations up to codimension two. The theory is applied to several models: the Stommel\textendash Cessi box model for the thermohaline circulation from geoscience, an epidemic-spreading model on an adaptive network, an activator\textendash inhibitor switch from systems biology, a predator\textendash prey system from ecology and to the Euler buckling problem from classical mechanics. For the Stommel\textendash Cessi model we compare different detrending techniques to calculate early-warning signs. In the epidemics model we show that link densities could be better variables for prediction than population densities. The activator\textendash inhibitor switch demonstrates effects in three time-scale systems and points out that excitable cells and molecular units have information for subthreshold prediction. In the predator\textendash prey model explosive population growth near a codimension-two bifurcation is investigated and we show that early-warnings from normal forms can be misleading in this context. In the biomechanical model we demonstrate that early-warning signs for buckling depend crucially on the control strategy near the instability which illustrates the effect of multiplicative noise.},

Knowing how much a user trusts a source can be very useful for aggregating, filtering, and ordering of information.

This paper describes a new approach that gives an explicit probabilistic interpretation for confidence in social networks. We describe SUNNY, a new trust inference algorithm that uses a probabilistic sampling technique to estimate our confidence in the trust information from some designated sources. SUNNY computes an estimate of trust based on only those information sources with high confidence estimates. In our experiments, SUNNY produced more accurate trust estimates than the well known trust inference algorithm TIDALTRUST (Golbeck 2005), demonstrating its effectiveness.},

  abstract = {Gaussian Graphical Models (GGMs) are extensively used in many research areas, such as genomics, proteomics, neuroimaging, and psychology, to study the partial correlation structure of a set of variables. This structure is visualized by drawing an undirected network, in which the variables constitute the nodes and the partial correlations the edges. In many applications, it makes sense to impose sparsity (i.e., some of the partial correlations are forced to zero) as sparsity is theoretically meaningful and/or because it improves the predictive accuracy of the fitted model. However, as we will show by means of extensive simulations, state-of-the-art estimation approaches for imposing sparsity on GGMs, such as the Graphical lasso, {$\mathscr{l}$}1 regularized nodewise regression, and joint sparse regression, fall short because they often yield too many false positives (i.e., partial correlations that are not properly set to zero). In this paper we present a new estimation approach that allows to control the false positive rate better. Our approach consists of two steps: First, we estimate an undirected network using one of the three state-of-the-art estimation approaches. Second, we try to detect the false positives, by flagging the partial correlations that are smaller in absolute value than a given threshold, which is determined through cross-validation; the flagged correlations are set to zero. Applying this new approach to the same simulated data, shows that it indeed performs better. We also illustrate our approach by using it to estimate (1) a gene regulatory network for breast cancer data, (2) a symptom network of patients with a diagnosis within the nonaffective psychotic spectrum and (3) a symptom network of patients with PTSD.},

Our research focuses on the diffusion process to track the temporal extent of information spread in the network. Over time, various models have been suggested in order to best represent the diffusion process. Our paper suggests a novel information diffusion model, time-aware opinion dynamics model (TODD), that derives from opinion dynamics and continuous time models in order to provide a more robust and realistic representation of the real-world problem.

  abstract = {This article is concerned with the Axelrod model, a stochastic process which similarly to the voter model includes social influence, but unlike the voter model also accounts for homophily. Each vertex of the network of interactions is characterized by a set of F cultural features, each of which can assume q states. Pairs of adjacent vertices interact at a rate proportional to the number of features they share, which results in the interacting pair having one more cultural feature in common. The Axelrod model has been extensively studied during the past ten years, based on numerical simulations and simple mean-field treatments, while there is a total lack of analytical results for the spatial model itself. Simulation results for the one-dimensional system led physicists to formulate the following conjectures. When the number of features F and the number of states q both equal two, or when the number of features exceeds the number of states, the system converges to a monocultural equilibrium in the sense that the number of cultural domains rescaled by the population size converges to zero as the population goes to infinity. In contrast, when the number of states exceeds the number of features, the system freezes in a highly fragmented configuration in which the ultimate number of cultural domains scales like the population size. In this article, we prove analytically for the one-dimensional system convergence to a monocultural equilibrium in terms of clustering when F = q = 2, as well as fixation to a highly fragmented configuration when the number of states is sufficiently larger than the number of features. Our first result also implies clustering of the one-dimensional constrained voter model.},

  abstract = {The Deffuant model is a spatial stochastic model for the dynamics of opinions in which individuals are located on a connected graph representing a social network and characterized by a number in the unit interval representing their opinion. The system evolves according to the following averaging procedure: pairs of neighbors interact independently at rate one if and only if the distance between their opinions does not exceed a certain confidence threshold, with each interaction resulting in the neighbors' opinions getting closer to each other. All the mathematical results collected so far about this model assume that the individuals are located on the integers. In contrast, we study the more realistic case where the social network can be any finite connected graph. In addition, we extend the opinion space to any bounded convex subset of a normed vector space where the norm is used to measure the level of disagreement or distance between the opinions. Our main result gives a lower bound for the probability of consensus. Interestingly, our proof leads to a universal lower bound that depends on the confidence threshold, the opinion space\textasciitilde (convex subset and norm) and the initial distribution, but not on the size or the topology of the social network.},

  abstract = {The dynamics of network social contagion processes such as opinion formation and epidemic spreading is often mediated by interactions between multiple nodes. Previous results have shown that these higher-order interactions can profoundly modify the dynamics of contagion processes, resulting in bistability, hysteresis, and explosive transitions. In this paper, we present and analyze a degree-based mean-field description of the dynamics of the SIS model on hypergraphs, i.e., networks with higher-order interactions. We derive a hyperdegree-based mean-field equation to describe the contagion dynamics, and illustrate its applicability with the example of a hypergraph where contagion is mediated by both links (pairwise interactions) and triangles (three-way interactions). We consider two different mechanisms of higher-order contagion and healing, and the cases where links and triangles connect preferentially to the same nodes, or are chosen independently of each other. We find that, when links and triangles are chosen independently, heterogeneity in the link degree distribution can suppress explosive transitions. In addition, explosive transitions are more likely to occur when node and triangle connections are positively correlated when compared to the case when they are chosen independently of each other. We verify these results with microscopic simulations of the contagion process and with analytic predictions derived from the mean-field model. Our results show that the structure of higher-order interactions can have important effects on contagion processes on hypergraphs.},

  abstract = {Emotions are part and parcel of the human condition, but their nature is debated. Three broad classes of theories about the nature of emotions can be distinguished: affect program theories, constructionist theories, and appraisal theories. Integrating them in a unifying theory is challenging. An integrative psychometric model of emotions can inform such a theory, because psychometric models are intertwined with theoretical perspectives about constructs. To identify an integrative psychometric model, we (a) delineate properties of emotions stated by emotion theories, and (b) investigate whether psychometric models account for these properties. Specifically, an integrative psychometric model of emotions should allow identifying distinct emotions (central in affect program theories), should allow between and within person variation of emotions (central in constructionist theories), and should allow causal relationships between emotion components (central in appraisal theories). Evidence suggests that the popular reflective and formative latent variable models\textemdash in which emotions are conceptualized as unobservable causes or consequences of emotion components\textemdash cannot account for all properties. Conversely, a psychometric network model\textemdash in which emotions are conceptualized as systems of causally interacting emotion components\textemdash accounts for all properties. The psychometric network model thus constitutes an integrative psychometric model of emotions, facilitating progress toward a unifying theory.},

We demonstrate on synthetic data that, when the sample size is small, the two methods produce graphs with either too few or too many edges when compared to the real one. As a result, we propose a composite procedure that explores a family of graphs with a nodewise numerical scheme and selects a candidate among them with an overall likelihood criterion. We demonstrate that, when the number of observations is small, this selection method yields graphs closer to the truth and corresponding to distributions with better KL divergence with regards to the real distribution than the other two. Finally, we show the interest of our algorithm on two concrete cases: first on brain imaging data, then on biological nephrology data. In both cases our results are more in line with current knowledge in each field.},

Moreover, requiring at most one line search over the regularization path of the graphical lasso, the calibration scheme is computationally more efficient than competing schemes that are based on resampling.

We propose that the process of decision-making in human life goes through three phases: The will phase, the choice phase, and the decision phase. Primary emotions of surprise and anticipation and self-organizing patterns of emotions such as curiosity, attraction, doubt, optimism, resourcefulness, open-mindedness, enjoyment of unknown, and enthusiasm play a significant role in this process.

In this case, a gap between new norms and old values may be created, which we call value/normative dissonance. This gap is likely to cause a strong inter- and intraclass value inconsistency. In this article, we analyze the spread of dominant value orientations among social classes in the present postsocialist system in Serbia. The analysis is based on the data obtained in the South-East European Social Survey Project (SEESSP) in which 2,997 respondents participated in December 2003/January 2004. We analyze the spread of two pairs of conflicting value orientations: (1) political liberalism vs. authoritarian collectivism, and (2) market liberalism vs. redistributive statism. We also check intraclass value consistency. The influence of possible normative/value dissonance upon the democratization and market transformation of Serbia is evaluated. We compare the results of our analysis with the findings of an analysis of data obtained in an earlier survey, Change in Class Structure and Mobility in Serbia, in which 3,660 respondents participated in 1989. Our decision to deal with the two value orientations mentioned above was based on a factor analysis of a number of statements hypothetically related to different value systems and was confirmed by principal components analysis (PCA). Based on these results, we form scales to represent political and market liberalism, on one side, and authoritarian, redistributive statism, on the other. In the third step, we use analysis of variance (ANOVA) of the scale scores to describe value consistency among and within the social classes.},

We demonstrate using Monte Carlo simulations that our measure is more reliable and stable across political units than commonly used indicators because it reduces measurement fluctuations associated with the MAUP.},

  abstract = {Conjoint analysis is a common tool for studying political preferences. The method disentangles patterns in respondents' favorability toward complex, multidimensional objects, such as candidates or policies. Most conjoints rely upon a fully randomized design to generate average marginal component effects (AMCEs). They measure the degree to which a given value of a conjoint profile feature increases, or decreases, respondents' support for the overall profile relative to a baseline, averaging across all respondents and other features. While the AMCE has a clear causal interpretation (about the effect of features), most published conjoint analyses also use AMCEs to describe levels of favorability. This often means comparing AMCEs among respondent subgroups. We show that using conditional AMCEs to describe the degree of subgroup agreement can be misleading as regression interactions are sensitive to the reference category used in the analysis. This leads to inferences about subgroup differences in preferences that have arbitrary sign, size, and significance. We demonstrate the problem using examples drawn from published articles and provide suggestions for improved reporting and interpretation using marginal means and an omnibus F-test. Given the accelerating use of these designs in political science, we offer advice for best practice in analysis and presentation of results.},

  abstract = {Interactions between elements, which are usually represented by networks, have to delineate potentially unequal relationships in terms of their relative importance or direction. The intrinsic unequal relationships of such kind, however, are opaque or hidden in numerous real systems. For instance, when a node in a network with limited interaction capacity spends its capacity to its neighboring nodes, the allocation of the total amount of interactions to them can be vastly diverse. Even if such potentially heterogeneous interactions epitomized by weighted networks are observable, as a result of the aforementioned ego-centric allocation of interactions, the relative importance or dependency between two interacting nodes can only be implicitly accessible. In this work, we precisely pinpoint such relative dependency by proposing the framework to discover hidden dependent relations extracted from weighted networks. For a given weighted network, we provide a systematic criterion to select the most essential interactions for individual nodes based on the concept of information entropy. The criterion is symbolized by assigning the effective number of neighbors or the effective out-degree to each node, and the resultant directed subnetwork decodes the hidden dependent relations by leaving only the most essential directed interactions. We apply our methodology to two time-stamped empirical network data, namely the international trade relations between nations in the world trade web (WTW) and the network of people in the historical record of Korea, Annals of the Joseon Dynasty (AJD). Based on the data analysis, we discover that the properties of mutual dependency encoded in the two systems are vastly different.},

  abstract = {Network data often exhibit block structures characterized by clusters of nodes with similar patterns of edge formation. When such relational data are complemented by additional information on exogenous node partitions, these sources of knowledge are typically included in the model to supervise the cluster assignment mechanism or to improve inference on edge probabilities. Although these solutions are routinely implemented, there is a lack of formal approaches to test if a given external node partition is in line with the endogenous clustering structure encoding stochastic equivalence patterns among the nodes in the network. To fill this gap, we develop a formal Bayesian testing procedure which relies on the calculation of the Bayes factor between a stochastic block model with known grouping structure defined by the exogenous node partition and an infinite relational model that allows the endogenous clustering configurations to be unknown, random and fully revealed by the block-connectivity patterns in the network. A simple Markov chain Monte Carlo method for computing the Bayes factor and quantifying uncertainty in the endogenous groups is proposed. This routine is evaluated in simulations and in an application to study exogenous equivalence structures in brain networks of Alzheimer's patients.},

  abstract = {Stochastic block models (SBM) are widely used in network science due to their interpretable structure that allows inference on groups of nodes having common connectivity patterns. Although providing a well established model\textendash based approach for community detection, such formulations are still the object of intense research to address the key problem of inferring the unknown number of communities. This has motivated the development of several probabilistic mechanisms to characterize the node partition process, covering solutions with fixed, random and infinite number of communities. In this article we provide a unified view of all these formulations within a single extended stochastic block model (ESBM), that relies on Gibbs\textendash type processes and encompasses most existing representations as special cases. Connections with Bayesian nonparametric literature open up new avenues that allow the natural inclusion of several unexplored options to model the nodes partition process and to incorporate node attributes in a principled manner. Among these new alternatives, we focus on the Gnedin process as an example of a probabilistic mechanism with desirable theoretical properties and nice empirical performance. A collapsed Gibbs sampler that can be applied to the whole ESBM class is proposed, and refined methods for estimation, uncertainty quantification and model assessment are outlined. The performance of ESBM is assessed in simulations and an application to bill co\textendash sponsorship networks in the Italian parliament, where we find key hidden block structures and core\textendash periphery patterns.},

We present an integrative theoretical account of how these non-substantive influences may affect the pattern of relationships between items. We also point out how this is relevant to the validity of conclusions drawn in research on ``general factors'' (of personality, psychopathology, and personality pathology) and on ``network models''.

  abstract = {Linear regression on a set of observations linked by a network has been an essential tool in modeling the relationship between response and covariates with additional network data. Despite its wide range of applications in many areas, such as social sciences and health-related research, the problem has not been well-studied in statistics so far. Previous methods either lack inference tools or rely on restrictive assumptions on social effects, and usually assume that networks are observed without errors, which is too good to be true in many problems. In this paper, we propose a linear regression model with nonparametric network effects. Our model does not assume that the relational data or network structure is exactly observed; thus, the method can be provably robust to a certain level of perturbation of the network structure. We establish a set of asymptotic inference results under a general requirement of the network perturbation and then study the robustness of our method in the specific setting when the perturbation comes from random network models. We discover a phase-transition phenomenon of inference validity concerning the network density when no prior knowledge about the network model is available, while also show the significant improvement achieved by knowing the network model. A by-product of our analysis is a rate-optimal concentration bound about subspace projection that may be of independent interest. We conduct extensive simulation studies to verify our theoretical observations, and demonstrate the advantage of our method over a few benchmarks in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency under different data-generating models. The method is then applied to adolescent network data to study gender and racial difference in social activities.},

Whereas the methodological literature has suggested various alternative solutions, these approaches face many criticisms, chief among them to be sensitive to the correct specification of temporal lags. Applied researchers are thus left with little guidance. Seeking to provide such guidance, we compare how different panel models perform under a range of different conditions. Our Monte Carlo simulations reveal that unlike conventional panel models, a cross-lagged panel model with fixed effects not only offers protection against bias arising from reverse causality under a wide range of conditions but also helps to circumvent the problem of misspecified temporal lags.},

In this context, we propose a generative multiplicative decrease process having an \emph{attrition function} that controls the rate of decrease of the population at each stage of the process. The discrete solution to the model takes the form of a product, and a continuous approximation of this solution is derived via the renewal equation that describes age-structured population dynamics. We also investigate some limited complexity variations of the attrition function within this model.},

This study examines one form of cognitive bias, hindsight bias. Hindsight bias refers to the tendency to retrospectively exaggerate one's foresight of a particular event. We argue that hindsight bias is a potential problem when it comes to retrospective evaluation due to the difficulty involved in separating our assessments of the pre-crisis period from the knowledge that a crisis occurred. Using disaggregated data from the Varieties of Democracy Project, we look for evidence of hindsight bias in coders' evaluations of the periods that preceded major crises of democracy. We find that coder disagreement is significantly higher in pre-crisis scenarios than in our control group. Concerningly, despite this disagreement, coders remain similarly confident in their assessments. This represents a potential problem for those who seek to use these data to study democratic breakdowns and transitions.},

Our analysis offers estimates of the ``optimal'' lead time for election forecasts, based on a dataset of over 26,000 vote intention polls from 338 elections in 44 countries between 1942 and 2014.

We derive results appropriate for a two-group experiment that instead presume the covariate is a normally distributed random variable. A simulation study is used to confirm the validity of the analytical results and to compare error estimates and confidence intervals based on these results with those based on assuming a fixed covariate. Discrepancies between estimates for fixed and random covariates of the variability of treatment effects can be substantial. However, in situations where the extent of heterogeneity of regression is like that typically reported, presuming the covariate is random rather than fixed will generally result in only a modest increase in estimated standard errors, and in some circumstances can even result in a smaller estimated standard error.

The prior sensitivity in BSEM-N was explored in factor analysis models with sparse loading structures through a simulation study (Study 1) and an empirical example (Study 2). Study 1 examined the prior sensitivity in BSEM-N based on the model fit, population model recovery, true and false positive rates, and parameter estimation. Seven shrinkage priors on cross-loadings and five noninformative/vague priors on other model parameters were examined. Study 2 provided a real data example to illustrate the impact of various priors on model fit and parameter selection and estimation. Results indicated that when the 95\% credible intervals of shrinkage priors barely covered the population cross-loading values, it resulted in the best balance between true and false positives. If the goal is to perform variable selection, a sparse cross-loading structure is required, preferably with a minimal number of nontrivial cross-loadings and relatively high primary loading values. To improve parameter estimates, a relatively large prior variance is preferred. When cross-loadings are relatively large, BSEM-N with zero-mean priors is not recommended for the estimation of cross-loadings and factor correlations.},

I first highlight three common inequality measures, the Gini index and two generalized entropy measures\textemdash Theil's T and Theil's L indices\textemdash by presenting their individual components as a method for evaluating inequality. Five artificial data examples illustrate the use of these individual components first. An empirical analysis of the 2007 and 2017 Current Population Survey data then focuses on the differences in inequality revealed by such individual inequality components between the 2007 and 2017. The individual-level inequality measures can reveal patterns of inequality concealed by single measures at the aggregate level. In particular, the Gini individual measures differentiate cases better than the generalized entropy measures and tend to have smaller standard errors in a regression analysis.},

The latter is to estimate the Bayes factors expressed as the ratio of posterior probabilities of two competing models. We also establish the asymptotic consistency property of the model selection procedure based on the Bayes factors. Our procedure avoids an exhaustive search which is computationally impossible. Our method is illustrated with simulations and a real-world application with a protein signalling data set.},

  abstract = {A generic feature of bounded confidence type models is the formation of clusters of agents. We propose and study a variant of bounded confidence dynamics with the goal of inducing unconditional convergence to a consensus. The defining feature of these dynamics which we name the No one left behind dynamics is the introduction of a local control on the agents which preserves the connectivity of the interaction network. We rigorously demonstrate that these dynamics result in unconditional convergence to a consensus. The qualitative nature of our argument prevents us quantifying how fast a consensus emerges, however we present numerical evidence that sharp convergence rates would be challenging to obtain for such dynamics. Finally, we propose a relaxed version of the control. The dynamics that result maintain many of the qualitative features of the bounded confidence dynamics yet ultimately still converges to a consensus as the control still maintains connectivity of the interaction network.},

A precondition for strategies aiming at attracting these voters is that parties perceive their voter potentials among their rivals' electorates correctly. Yet, hardly anything is known about such perceptions. To fill this gap, we develop analogue measures of a party's perceived and its actual voter potential for each competitor in a party system. Combining elite and mass surveys conducted in Germany, we show that perceived and actual voter potentials depend on spatial considerations but also that not all parties are able to correctly evaluate their potentials. These deviations can be traced back to differences in the perceived placement of political actors between elites and citizens. This supports the spatial logic of party competition but it also points to potential pitfalls for strategic behavior of political parties.},

It has been argued that differences within electorates across Europe are found in disputes over taxes, redistribution of wealth and social welfare, as much as in divergent ideas on how to deal with globalisation, migration, and climate change. This article uses the 2016\textendash 2017 round of the European Social Survey (N\,=\,1959) to shed light on two important issues in regard to the relationship between `old' and `new' politics. By using multiple correspondence analysis, we first consider the structure, or dimensionality, of the space of political attitudes in contemporary UK society. Contrary to a prevailing discourse that forwards the argument that postmaterial values constitute an altogether separate political dimension in late modernity, we observe that such values collapse into traditional left/right standpoints. Second, we discuss the connection between class (economic capital, cultural capital, and occupational class) and position-takings in the space of political attitudes. We show that class retains a limited effect on political position-takings, where educational capital plays the most important role. The divisions between the politically interested\textendash uninterested, old\textendash young, men\textendash women, and rural\textendash urban are more clearly demarcated than differences between people of different social class positions. Furthermore, polarisation is most prevalent between a highly opinionated, relatively resourceful, small minority of the population.},

We confirm our argument by fielding two survey experiments in a context with two distinct issue dimensions: the left-right and national dimensions in Catalonia. We find that the position of a hypothetical (but plausible) candidate on a national dimension exerts a great deal of influence on where respondents locate him on the left-right dimension, as well as on a more narrowly-defined socioeconomic dimension, but that the left-right position does not affect the perceived placement on the national divide. This asymmetry can be partly explained by the different nature of these issue domains, and specifically by the distinct ability of the national dimension to activate social group cues that give rise to projection biases. These findings have important implications for our understanding of issue misperceptions and of the strategic choices available to parties in multidimensional policy spaces. The nature of the issue dimension could facilitate why some issue dimensions tend to function as cue givers and others as cue receivers. We discuss the implications of our findings in constraining the strategies available to parties in multidimensional contexts.},

Recently, the implicit community structure is widely used to improve the efficiency of research. However, most of the non-overlapping community detection algorithms have some weakness, such as the large number of community detected and the obvious scale gap between communities. To address these abovementioned problems, we design a novel non-overlapping community detection algorithm, named as Pairing, Splitting and Aggregating algorithm (i.e., PSA). Firstly, in order to improve the accuracy of community division, a new node similarity index is designed to transform the network into a large number of similar node pairs. Secondly, based on the connected branches composed of similar node pairs, the network is further divided into several similar node sets. Thirdly, to balance the scale gap of different communities, the Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm, (i.e., GOA) is introduced to combine the local attribute (i.e., conductance) and global attribute (i.e., modularity) together to aggregate similar node sets into potential (or final) communities. Finally, the experimental results show that PSA not only controls the difference among communities well, but also outperforms the other four popular algorithms in terms of two metrics. Moreover, we propose a community-based resource discovery method (or scheme), named as Community-assisted Short-distance-query Resource Discovery algorithm (i.e., CSRD) to further verify the efficiency of PSA. The results show that the resource discovery efficiency of CSRD using PSA is better compared with other algorithms.},

And the structural properties of these networks often critically determine the properties and function of the resulting mathematical models. An important method to infer the correlations between topology and function is the detection of community structure, which plays a key role in the analysis, design, and optimization of many complex systems. The nonnegative matrix factorization has been used prolifically to that effect in recent years, although it cannot guarantee balanced partitions, and it also does not allow a proactive computation of the number of communities in a network. This indicates that the nonnegative matrix factorization does not satisfy all the nonnegative low-rank approximation conditions. Here we show how to resolve this important open problem by optimizing the identifiability of community structure. We propose a new form of nonnegative matrix decomposition and a probabilistic surrogate learning function that can be solved according to the majorization\textendash minimization principle. Extensive in silico tests on artificial and real-world data demonstrate the efficient performance in community detection, regardless of the size and complexity of the network.},

Compared to the existing literature, user influence is assessed on the basis of users' text-based and behaviors-based characteristics rather than the network structures only. Moreover, whether the influential users have always been those with strong connections on the social networking site is also discussed.

Formally, the PIV is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis again based on both the observed sample and the counterfactuals, provided the same null hypothesis has already been rejected based on the observed sample. Under either frequentist or Bayesian framework, one can bound the PIV of an inference based on his bounded belief about the counterfactuals, which is often needed when the unconfoundedness assumption is dubious. The PIV is equivalent to statistical power when the NHST is thought to be based on both the observed sample and the counterfactuals. We summarize the process of evaluating internal validity with the PIV into a six-step procedure and illustrate it with an empirical example.},

Different from traditional social network, EBSNs contain different types of entities and links, and users in EBSNs have more complex behaviours. This leads to poor performance of the traditional social influence computation method in EBSNs. Therefore, to quantify the pairwise social influence accurately in EBSNs, we first propose to compute two types of social influences, i.e., structure-based social influence and behaviour-based social influence, by utilizing the online social network structure and offline social behaviours of users. In particular, based on the specific features of EBSNs, the similarities of user preference on three aspects (i.e., topics, regions and organizers) are utilized to measure the behaviour-based social influence. Then, we obtain the unified pairwise social influence by combining these two types of social influences through a weight function. Next, we present a social influence based community detection algorithm which is referred to as SICD. In SICD, inspired by the nonlinear feature learning ability of the autoencoder, we first devise a neighborhood based deep autoencoder algorithm to obtain nonlinear community-oriented latent representations of users, and then utilize the k-means algorithm for community detection. Experimental results conducted on real-world dataset show the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.},

In this paper, we propose a new way of measuring degree-degree dependencies. One of the problems with the commonly used assortativity coefficient is that in disassortative networks its magnitude decreases with the network size. We mathematically explain this phenomenon and validate the results on synthetic graphs and real-world network data. As an alternative, we suggest to use rank correlation measures such as Spearman's {$\rho$}. Our experiments convincingly show that Spearman's {$\rho$} produces consistent values in graphs of different sizes but similar structure, and it is able to reveal strong (positive or negative) dependencies in large graphs. In particular, we discover much stronger negative degree-degree dependencies in Web graphs than was previously thought. Rank correlations allow us to compare the assortativity of networks of different sizes, which is impossible with the assortativity coefficient due to its genuine dependence on the network size. We conclude that rank correlations provide a suitable and informative method for uncovering network mixing patterns.},

In this paper, we study the spatial evolutionary prisoner's dilemma game with the introduction of the strategy-updating cost for players, where each player is able to update its strategy if its payoffs is greater than a critical threshold. We show that there exist sudden increases of cooperation level as the temptation to defect increases for a fixed strategy-updating cost, which means a larger temptation to defect cannot always inveigle players into defection, but sometimes promote players to cooperate. This striking phenomenon is in contradiction with the previous wide cognition that a larger temptation to defect always gives rise to a lower cooperation level. This abnormal phenomenon can be explained by a systematic analysis of the payoffs earned by cooperators and defectors and the strategy-transition probabilities between cooperation and defection, respectively. In some cases, the strategy-updating cost can prevent some defectors from becoming cooperators and the increase of temptation to defect enable their payoffs to exceed the threshold of strategy-updating cost. Our results prove that the temptation to defect may have facilitation to the emergence of cooperation in the existence of strategy-updating cost, and thus provide a new understanding of the previously hidden roles of the temptation to defect for the social cooperation.},

  abstract = {In social systems, the evolution of interpersonal appraisals and individual opinions are not independent processes but intertwine with each other. Despite extensive studies on both opinion dynamics and appraisal dynamics separately, no previous work has ever combined these two processes together. In this paper, we propose a novel and intuitive model on the interplay between homophily-based appraisal dynamics and influence-based opinion dynamics. We assume that individuals' opinions are updated via the influence network constructed from their interpersonal appraisals, which are in turn updated based on the individual opinions via the homophily mechanism. By theoretical analysis, we characterize the set of equilibria and some transient behavior of our model. Moreover, we establish the equivalence among the convergence of the appraisal network to social balance, the modulus consensus of individual opinions, and the non-vanishing appraisals. Monte Carlo validations further show that the non-vanishing appraisals condition holds for generic initial conditions. Compared with previous works that explain the emergence of social balance via person-to-person homophily mechanism, our model provides an alternative explanation in terms of the person-to-entity homophily mechanism. In addition, our model also describes how individuals' opinions on multiple irrelevant issues become correlated and converge to modulus consensus over time-varying influence networks.},

  abstract = {Massive trust assessment (MTA) in an Online Social Network (OSN), i.e., computing the trustworthiness of all users in the network, is crucial in various OSN-related applications. Existing solutions are either too slow or inaccurate in addressing the MTA problem. We propose the OpinionWalk algorithm that accurately and efficiently conducts MTA in an OSN. OpinionWalk models trust by the Dirichlet distribution and uses a matrix to represent the direct trust relations among users. From the perspective of a user, other users' trustworthiness are stored in a column vector that is iteratively updated when the algorithm ``walks'' through the network, in a breadth-first search manner. We identify the overlapping subproblems property in MTA and prove OpinionWalk is a more efficient solution. The accuracy and execution time of OpinionWalk are evaluated and compared to benchmark algorithms including EigenTrust, TrustRank, MoleTrust, TidalTrust and AssessTrust, using two real-world datasets (Advogato and Pretty Good Privacy). Experimental results indicate that OpinionWalk is an efficient and accurate solution to MTA, compared to previous algorithms.},

  abstract = {Most of traditional trajectory clustering algorithms often cluster similar trajectories from a temporal or spatial perspective. One weak point is that the semantic relationship between the trajectories is ignored. In some cases, trajectories with spatio-temporal similarities may be semantically related, and the negligence of semantic information may result in unreasonable trajectory clustering results. In addition, the existing semantic trajectory clustering algorithms only consider the local semantic relationship between adjacent spatio-temporal trajectories, and the overall global semantic relationship between trajectories is still unknown. Considering the disadvantages of the current trajectory clustering methods, we proposed a novel algorithm for semantic trajectory clustering based on community detection (STCCD) in networks, which can better measure the semantic similarity of trajectories and capture global relationship among trajectories from the perspective of the network, and can get better trajectory clustering results compared to some traditional and recently proposed methods. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively mine the trajectory clustering information and related knowledge from the semantic trajectory data.},

However, fine-grained decompositions of specific indirect or mediated effects along separate paths are only valid under stringent assumptions, such as a correctly specified causal structure of the mediators, and no unobserved confounding of the mediators. In this article, we introduce a new type of direct and indirect effects for multiple mediators, called interventional effects, from the causal inference and epidemiology literature. While the framework for interventional direct and indirect effects can accommodate nonlinear models for the means of the mediators and/or the outcome in general, we will focus on a particular class of linear models widely used for multiple mediation analysis. We demonstrate how the interventional indirect effects through each distinct mediator can be unbiasedly estimated using prevalent path analysis methods within the linear structural equation modeling (SEM) framework. The estimators do not require specifying the directions of the causal effects between the mediators, and are unbiased (in large samples) even when the mediators share hidden or unobserved common causes. The estimation method is utilized to assess the effect of political inclusion on political prejudice that is possibly mediated by six distinct mediators.},

Controlling for social integration (i.e. the individual number of social connections), I found that density fosters higher levels of trust. In particular, results show that people in denser communities are more likely to trust their unknown fellow citizens, encouraging isolated subjects to engage with strangers. However, evidence did not support the idea that community social embeddedness causes an increase of trustworthiness, indicating that the spillover effect works only with respect to trust.},

They have raised a fair amount of attention in the communities of social simulation, sociophysics and complexity science. The researchers working on it come from disciplines such as physics, mathematics, computer science, social psychology and philosophy.In these models agents hold continuous opinions which they can gradually adjust if they hear the opinions of others. The idea of bounded confidence is that agents only interact if they are close in opinion to each other. Usually, the models are analyzed with agent-based simulations in a Monte Carlo style, but they can also be reformulated on the agent's density in the opinion space in a master equation style. The contribution of this survey is fourfold. First, it will present the agent-based and density-based modeling frameworks including the cases of multidimensional opinions and heterogeneous bounds of confidence. Second, it will give the bifurcation diagrams of cluster configuration in the homogeneous model with uniformly distributed initial opinions. Third, it will review the several extensions and the evolving phenomena which have been studied so far, and fourth it will state some open questions.},

For experimenting with theories, various psychological theories of persuasive communication are implemented. The model allows for investigating the effects of contagion and assimilation, motivated cognition, polarity, source credibility, and idiosyncratic attitude formation. The simulations show that different theories produce different characteristic macro-level patterns. Central mechanisms for generating consensus can be contagion and assimilation. However, the former generates a radicalized consensus. Motivated cognition tends to cause societal polarization of attitudes. Polarity and source credibility have comparatively little effect on the societal distribution of attitudes. We discuss how the simulations provide a bridge between micro-level psychological theories and the aggregated macro level studied by sociology. This, in turn, enables complementing experimental studies by new types of evidence for evaluating social psychological theory.},

  abstract = {Collective action is volatile: characterized by swift, unexpected changes in intensity, target, and forms. We conduct a detailed exploration of four reasons that these changes occur. First, action is about identities which are fluid, contested, and multifaceted. As the content of groups' identities change, so do the specific norms for the identities. Second, social movements adopt new tactics, or forms of collective action. Tactical changes may arise from changes in identity, but also changes in the target or opponent groups, and changes in the relationships with targets and with other actors. Factions or wings of a group in conflict may in turn form identities based on opposition or support for differing tactics. Third, social movements change because participant motivation ebbs, surges, and also changes in quality (e.g., becoming more subjectively autonomous, or self-determined). Finally, political social change occurs within socio-political structures; these structures implicate higher-level norms, which both constrain and emerge from actions (e.g., state openness or repression). Our analysis presents idealized and descriptive models of these relationships, and a new model to examine tactical changes empirically, the DIME model. This model highlights that collective actors can Disidentify after failure (giving up and walking away); they can Innovate, or try something new; and they can commit harder, convinced that they are right, with increased moral urgency (Moralization) and redoubled efforts (Energization).},

  abstract = {Robustness of the network controllability reflects how well a networked system can maintain its controllability against destructive attacks. The measure of the network controllability robustness is quantified by a sequence of values that record the remaining controllability of the network after a sequence of node-removal or edge-removal attacks. Traditionally, the controllability robustness is determined by attack simulations, which is computationally time consuming. In this paper, an improved method for predicting the controllability robustness of undirected networks is developed based on machine learning using a convolutional neural network. This approach is motivated by the following observations: 1) there is no clear correlation between the topological features and the controllability robustness of a general undirected network, 2) the adjacency matrix of a network can be represented as a gray-scale image, 3) the convolutional neural network technique has proved successful in image processing without human intervention. In the new framework, preprocessing and filtering are embedded, and a sufficiently large number of training datasets generated by simulations are used to train several convolutional neural networks for classification and prediction, respectively. Extensive experimental studies were carried out, which demonstrate that the proposed framework for predicting the controllability robustness of undirected networks is more accurate and reliable than the conventional single convolutional neural network predictor.},

A single user who consents to allow access to their own profile can thereby expose the personal data of their network connections to non-consented access. The traditional (informed individual) consent model is therefore not appropriate in online social networks where informed consent may not be possible for all users affected by data processing and where information is shared and distributed across many nodes. Here, we introduce a model of "distributed consent" where individuals and groups can coordinate by giving consent conditional on that of their network connections. We model the impact of distributed consent on the observability of social networks and find that relatively low adoption of even the simplest formulation of distributed consent would allow macroscopic subsets of online networks to preserve their connectivity and privacy. Distributed consent is of course not a silver bullet, since it does not follow data as it flows in and out of the system, but it is one of the most straightforward non-traditional models to implement and it better accommodates the fuzzy, distributed nature of online data.},

Using rounds 1\textendash 8 of the European Social Surveys, I find evidence from 92 elections in 27 European countries that both the levels of and the difference between satisfaction levels of ``winners'' and ``losers'' do not attenuate quickly but rather last almost 5\,years. That is, it appears that ``winners'' are more satisfied with democracy and stay that way. While this confirms earlier, smaller studies, the absence of a causal connection between the time from election and satisfaction levels poses a significant challenge to the current literature about the electoral mechanism of this relationship.},

However, there is no theory defining the maximization performance in more realistic networks where edges are heterogeneously distributed within and between communities. We establish the asymptotic theoretical bounds on the resolution parameter of generalized modularity using the random graph properties. From this new perspective on random graph model, we find the resolution limit of modularity maximization can be explained in a surprisingly simple and straightforward way. Given a network produced by the stochastic block models, the communities for which the resolution parameter is larger than their densities are likely to be spread among multiple clusters; while communities for which the resolution parameter is smaller than their background inter-community edge density get merged into one large component. Therefore, no suitable resolution parameter exits when the intra-community edge density in a subgraph is lower than the inter-community edge density in some other subgraph. For such networks, we propose a progressive agglomerative heuristic algorithm to detect statistically significant communities at multiple scales.},

To disentangle decision-making mechanisms by units, traditional discrete choice models focus exclusively on the conditional mean and ignore the heterogeneous effects within a population. This paper proposes a conditional binary quantile model that goes beyond this limitation to analyze discrete response data with varying alternative-specific features. This model offers an in-depth understanding of the relationship between the explanatory and response variables. Compared to conditional mean-based models, the conditional binary quantile model relies on weak distributional assumptions and is more robust to distributional misspecification. The model also relaxes the assumption of the independence of irrelevant alternatives, which is often violated in practice. The method is applied to a range of political studies to show the heterogeneous effects of explanatory variables across the conditional distribution. Substantive interpretations from counterfactual scenarios are used to illustrate how the conditional binary quantile model captures unobserved heterogeneity, which extant models fail to do. The results point to the risk of averaging out the heterogeneous effects across units by conditional mean-based models.},

An effective reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler is proposed for estimating the parameters and the number of blocks for this generalised SBM. The methodology permits non-conjugate distributions for edge weights, which enable more flexible modelling than current methods as illustrated on synthetic data, a network of brain activity and an email communication network.},

Yet lacking from these approaches is the notion that, depending on the situation and relationship, the same behavior by the same person can be considered more or less moral. The author reviews recent trends in sociological theorizing about morality and calls attention to the neglect of situational variations and social perceptions as mediating influences on judgment. She then analyzes the moral machine experiment to demonstrate how situations and relationships inform moral cognition.

Traditional opinion dynamics models focus on the heterogeneity of regular users, but ignore the heterogeneity of media users in social networks. Compared to regular users, media users have the characteristics of releasing more information and having greater influence, and their opinions are not easily affected by regular users. Aiming at the characteristics of information transmission with the participation of media users, we propose an opinion dynamics model to reproduce a realistic process of opinion interaction between regular users and media users and between regular users, respectively. The time variable is also incorporated into the probability of opinion adoption to make sure the opinion interaction model has timeliness. The simulation experiments on models of four typical complex network structures have shown that the characteristic of large average path length in a regular network will lead to the media opinion spreading slowly with a small scope, and a low individual opinion interaction frequency. On the other hand, the characteristics of strong heterogeneity and many center users in a scale-free network lead to media opinion spreading fast with a big scope. Moreover, the opinion adoption probability has a great influence on the average opinion value of the final state in four networks, while the bounded trust threshold has a great influence on opinion evolution in regular networks and scale-free networks. Furthermore, the media location selection approach based on the node betweenness results in opinion influence transmission with high speed and large range compared with the approaches based on node degree and clustering coefficient.},

  abstract = {Graph embedding has become a key component of many data mining and analysis systems. Current graph embedding approaches either sample a large number of node pairs from a graph to learn node embeddings via stochastic optimization or factorize a high-order node proximity/adjacency matrix via computationally intensive matrix factorization techniques. These approaches typically require significant resources for the learning process and rely on multiple parameters, which limits their applicability in practice. Moreover, most of the existing graph embedding techniques operate effectively in one specific metric space only (e.g., the one produced with cosine similarity), do not preserve higher-order structural features of the input graph and cannot automatically determine a meaningful number of dimensions for the embedding space. Typically, the produced embeddings are not easily interpretable, which complicates further analyses and limits their applicability. To address these issues, we propose DAOR, a highly efficient and parameter-free graph embedding technique producing metric space-robust, compact and interpretable embeddings without any manual tuning. Compared to a dozen state-of-the-art graph embedding algorithms, DAOR yields competitive results on both node classification (which benefits form high-order proximity) and link prediction (which relies on low-order proximity mostly). Unlike existing techniques, however, DAOR does not require any parameter tuning and improves the embeddings generation speed by several orders of magnitude. Our approach has hence the ambition to greatly simplify and speed up data analysis tasks involving graph representation learning.},

  abstract = {Objective Why, despite positive feelings toward the poor and working classes, relative to the rich and big business, has American public support for redistribution failed to appreciably increase during an era of high, and rising, income inequality? Methods I argue that this puzzling disconnect is due, in part, to a lack of general political knowledge. Using survey data from the 2012 American National Election Study, I test how political knowledge conditions the relationship between people's economic class group attitudes and their support for redistribution. Results People with low (high) levels of political knowledge weakly (strongly) connect their class attitudes with support for redistributive spending and progressive taxation. Data from four ANES panel studies show that this does not result from the less knowledgeable holding weak ``nonattitudes'' toward these class groups. Rather, consistent with Converse's classic work, I attribute this to less knowledgeable individuals lacking awareness about how redistributive policies benefit different social groups. Conclusion These findings help us to better understand an important puzzle in American politics: why a mass public that purports to favor the poor and working classes over the economic elite has not turned more strongly in favor of redistribution during an era of historic inequality.},

In Study 1, groups outperformed markets when there were no conflicts of interest among participants, whereas markets outperformed groups when conflicts of interest were present. Also, participants had more trust in groups to uncover hidden profiles than in markets. Study 2 generalized these findings to a simple prediction task, confirming that people had more trust in groups than in markets. These results were not qualified by conflicts of interest. Drawing on experienced forecasters from Good Judgment Open, Study 3 found that familiarity and experience with markets increased the endorsement and use of markets relative to traditional committees.},

  abstract = {Synchronization pertains to the property of interconnected systems according to which their dynamic behavior is coordinated in an appropriate sense. That is to say, some of their state variables, or functions of the latter for that matter, converge to each other. Synchronization may occur naturally or may be induced, controlled, and it may be present between two systems or among a large number. In the latter case, it is convenient to speak of a network of interconnected systems. Understanding synchronization, and how to control it, is an important paradigm as it is present in a variety of scenarios. These involve, e.g., networks of technological systems (robots and vehicles of different kinds), social networks (by which people exchange opinions and agree, or not), networks of biological systems (uni or pluricellular), etc. Owing to the context, the mathematical models to describe such networks and to define synchronization formally, varies dramatically. Ordinary continuous-time or discrete-time models for which modern control theory and Lyapunov stability theory are tailored result inappropriate to incorporate hybrid phenomena that intervene in the network. These may stem from sudden topology changes, the use of digital or intermittent control strategies, the presence of impacts in the intrinsic dynamics of the nodes, etc. In this invited paper, we give an overview of synchronization control problems, mostly of cooperative control of networks of autonomous vehicles (based on continuous-time models). For that matter, the first part of the paper focuses on the main contributions of [1]. Then, we give further perspectives on what we consider significant open problems on synchronization of hybrid systems and hybrid networks.},

This paper presents an online parallel overlapping community detection approach based on a speaker-listener propagation algorithm by proposing a novel parallel algorithm and applying three new metrics. This approach is presented to improve modularity and expand scalability for getting a significantly speedup in low time-consuming and usage memory through an agent-based parallel implementation in a multi-core architecture. The key ideas of our approach are increasing the communities' conductance score, limiting the speaking-listening stages and executing a strategic updating order to develop a speaker-listeners label propagation algorithm for getting better speedup and semi-deterministic results without using prior training or requiring particular predefined features. Experimental results of used large datasets compared with state-of-the-art algorithms show that the proposed method is extremely convergence and achieves an average 820\% speedup in the label propagation algorithm, and significantly improves the modularity that are effective in finding better overlapping communities in a linear time complexity O(m) and lower usage memory O(n).},

However, in times of rapid societal change, novel opinion-based groups can emerge and provide a new basis for partisan identification and divergent collective behaviour. Here, we use network methods to map the emergence of opposing opinion-based groups and assess their implications for public health behaviour. In a longitudinal study, we tracked public health attitudes and self-reported behaviour in a sample of UK participants over four time points. Network visualisation reveal a rift in attitudinal alignment over time and the genesis of two distinct groups characterised by trust, or distrust, in science (Study 1a; N = 253). These groups also diverge in public health behaviour. In a brief follow-up study (N = 206), we find that this opinion polarization partially reflects underlying societal divides. We discuss implications for opinion-based group research and public health campaigns.},

In addition to the classical transition from global consensus to opinion polarization, our main findings are (i) a cascade of fragmentation of the social network into echo chambers (modules) holding distinct opinions and rupture of the bridges interconnecting these modules as the tolerance for opinion differences increases. There are multiple surviving opinions associated to these modules within which consensus is formed; and (ii) the adaptive social network exhibits a hysteresis-like behavior characterized by irreversible changes in its topology as the opinion tolerance cycles from radicalization towards consensus and backward to radicalization.},

  abstract = {The spread of false information on social networks has garnered ample scientific and popular attention. To counteract this spread, verification of the truthfulness of information has been proposed as a key intervention. Using a behavioral experiment with over 2000 participants we analyze individuals' willingness to spread false information in a network. All individuals in the network have aligned incentives, making lying attractive, countering an explicit norm of truthtelling that we imposed. We investigate how verifying the truth, endogenously or exogenously, impacts the choices to lie or to adhere to the norm of truth-telling, compared to a setting without the possibility of verification. The three key take-aways are: (i) verification is only moderately effective in reducing the spread of lies; its effectivity is (ii) contingent on the agency of individuals to seek truth, and (iii) the exposure of liars, and not only the lies told. These suggest that verification is not a blanket solution. In order to enhance its effectivity, it should be combined with fostering a culture of truth-seeking and with information on who spreads lies, not only on the lies told.},

In this state, actors at network nodes classify other individuals as enemies or friends. Hence, the network contains two kinds of links: positive and negative. Here a new cellular automaton is designed and investigated, which mimics the time evolution towards the structural balance. The automaton is deterministic and synchronous.

If Western citizens who are open to authoritarian governance share a common set of political preferences, then authoritarian elites can attract mass coalitions that are willing to subvert democracy to achieve shared ideological goals. With this in mind, we explored which ideological groups are most open to authoritarian governance within Western general publics using World Values Survey data from fourteen Western democracies and three recent Latin American Public Opinion Project samples from Canada and the United States. Two key findings emerged. First, cultural conservatism was consistently associated with openness to authoritarian governance. Second, within half of the democracies studied, including all of the English-speaking ones, Western citizens holding a protection-based attitude package⸺combining cultural conservatism with left economic attitudes⸺were the most open to authoritarian governance. Within other countries, protection-based and consistently right-wing attitude packages were associated with similarly high levels of openness to authoritarian governance. We discuss implications for radical right populism and the possibility of splitting potentially undemocratic mass coalitions along economic lines.},

Predicting a society's majority opinion about a specific topic is an interesting challenge with many applications, e.g., predicting social movements, political votings, economical marketing. Among the various opinion formation models, the social impact model of opinion formation is very suitable for online social networks and online communities. In this model, three main factors affect a society's overall opinion: (1) the initial population of opinion groups, (2) the noise of the individuals to be persuaded or persist on their opinions, and (3) the topology of the network of interactions among individuals. In this research, to analyze the effect of segregation on the dynamics of opinion in the model, we assumed a noise-free model. Furthermore, the network of individuals is a scale-free network, and the initial population size of both opinion groups are the same with randomly assigned opinions. Using an agent-based modeling approach, we studied how the segregation of opinion groups may affect the dynamics of opinion formation. The results reveal that there is a strong correlation between segregation and the trend of society's opinion. It could be concluded from the results that if starting from the same population size in both opinion groups, it is expected that the more segregated opinion group dominates the less one and determines the majority opinion of the society.},

This is a very challenging task in complex interacting systems, where statistical stability is often poor due to lack of stationarity and ergodicity. Here, we describe an unsupervised, data-driven framework to perform hypothesis testing in such situations. This consists of a statistical mechanical approach\textemdash analogous to the configuration model for networked systems\textemdash for ensembles of time series designed to preserve, on average, some of the statistical properties observed on an empirical set of time series.

Despite the ubiquitous and successful applications of these algorithms, we argue that our understanding of their performance and their applications to real-world problems face three fundamental challenges: (1) rankings might be biased by various factors; (2) their effectiveness might be limited to specific problems; and (3) agents' decisions driven by rankings might result in potentially vicious feedback mechanisms and unhealthy systemic consequences.

In a recent article published in this journal, Brusco, Steinley, Hoffman, Davis-Stober, and Wasserman (in press) provide a critical assessment of the conditions that underlie the Ising model and the eLasso method that is commonly used to estimate it. In this commentary, we show that their main criticisms are unfounded. First, where Brusco et al. suggest that Ising models have little to do with classical network models such as random graphs, we show that they can be fruitfully connected. Second, if one makes this connection it is immediately evident that Brusco et al.'s second criticism \textendash{} that the Ising model requires complete population homogeneity and does not allow for individual differences in network structure \textendash{} is incorrect. In particular, we establish that if every individual has their own network, and these individual differences instantiate a random graph model, the Ising model will hold in the population. Hence, population homogeneity is sufficient for the Ising model, but it is not necessary, as Brusco et al. suggest. Third, we address Brusco et al.'s criticism regarding the sparsity assumption that is made in common uses of the Ising model. We show that this criticism is misdirected, as it targets a particular estimation algorithm for the Ising model rather than the model itself. We also describe various established and validated approaches for estimating the Ising model for networks that violate the sparsity assumption. Finally, we outline important avenues for future research.},

  abstract = {The Ising model is a graphical model that has played an essential role in the field of network psychometrics, where it has been used as a theoretical model to re-conceptualize psychometric concepts and as a statistical model for the analysis of psychological data. But in network psychometrics, the psychological data that are analyzed often come from cross-sectional applications, and the practice of using graphical models such as the Ising model to analyze these data has been heavily critiqued in the past few years. The primary voiced concern centers around the inability of the Ising model to express heterogeneity in the population, and the necessity to then assume that the population is homogeneous w.r.t. the network's structure in practice. But associations at the group-level may be entirely different from associations at the individual level, and it is unclear what the estimated relations from cross-sectional data imply for associations at the individual level. In this paper, an idiographic interpretation of the Ising model is developed that does not require that persons are exchangeable replications of a single topological structure. Working with a clear, formal connection between network relations at the individual- and the group level, we have unique topological structures that characterize individuals and aggregate into an Ising model cross-sectionally.},

In such models, the covariance between observables (e.g., symptoms like depressed mood, feelings of worthlessness, and guilt) is explained in terms of a pattern of causal interactions between these observables, which contrasts with classical interpretations in which the observables are conceptualized as the effects of a reflective latent variable. However, few investigations have been directed at the question how these different models relate to each other. To shed light on this issue, the current paper explores the relation between one of the most important network models\textemdash the Ising model from physics\textemdash and one of the most important latent variable models\textemdash the Item Response Theory (IRT) model from psychometrics. The Ising model describes the interaction between states of particles that are connected in a network, whereas the IRT model describes the probability distribution associated with item responses in a psychometric test as a function of a latent variable. Despite the divergent backgrounds of the models, we show a broad equivalence between them and also illustrate several opportunities that arise from this connection.},

Second, to render the application of Ising networks feasible, we use a latent variable representation to apply a low-rank approximation to the network's connectivity matrix.

In a recent paper in this journal, Forbes, Wright, Markon, and Krueger (FWMK) voiced the concern that GGMs that are estimated from partial correlations wrongfully remove the variance that is shared by its constituents. If true, this concern has grave consequences for the application of GGMs. Indeed, if partial correlations only capture the unique covariances, then the data that come from a unidimensional latent variable model ULVM should be associated with an empty network (no edges), as there are no unique covariances in a ULVM. We know that this cannot be true, which suggests that FWMK are missing something with their claim. We introduce a connection between the ULVM and the GGM and use that connection to prove that we find a fully-connected and not an empty network associated with a ULVM. We then use the relation between GGMs and linear regression to show that the partial correlation indeed does not remove the common variance.},

When learning these graphs from data, different amounts of information may be available for different edges.

Here, we propose a Bayesian method, namely baycn (BAYesian Causal Network), to estimate the posterior probability of three states for each inferred edge: present with one direction (X \textrightarrow{} Y), present with the opposite direction (X {$\leftarrow$} Y), and absent. Unlike existing Bayesian methods, our method requires that the prior probabilities of the three states be specified, and therefore provides a coherent interpretation of the posterior probabilities. We develop a fast MetropolisHastings Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for the inference. To perform the inference efficiently, our algorithm takes as input a candidate graph, which may be the output of another graph inference method and may contain false edges. In simulation studies our method achieves high accuracy with small variation across different scenarios and is comparable or better than existing Bayesian methods.},

  abstract = {We examine a dynamic two-stage incumbent-challenger model of internal conflict, where the government, i.e., the incumbent, is in power, while the rebel challenges the government in a bid to capture state power. The central issue is the trade-off between development and security-based measures in countering such rebellion activity. We find that while an exogenous \emph{increase} in development decreases the level of rebellion activity, it \emph{increases} the level of security-based measures by the government whenever the rebel is 'dominant' to begin with. Further, if the rebel is dominant, then, with the rebel becoming stronger (i.e., becoming more cost efficient), the level of rebel activity increases, while the security-based measures by the government is lowered. Thus, our analysis suggests that the trade-off is a nuanced one. This framework also allows us to reconcile some divergent results in the empirical literature regarding the effect of development works on conflict.},

  abstract = {Measurement errors are omnipresent in network data. Most studies observe an erroneous network instead of the desired error-free network. It is well known that such errors can have a severe impact on network metrics, especially on centrality measures: a central node in the observed network might be less central in the underlying, error-free network. The robustness is a common concept to measure these effects. Studies have shown that the robustness primarily depends on the centrality measure, the type of error (e.g., missing edges or missing nodes), and the network topology (e.g., tree-like, core-periphery). Previous findings regarding the influence of network size on the robustness are, however, inconclusive. We present empirical evidence and analytical arguments indicating that there exist arbitrary large robust and non-robust networks and that the average degree is well suited to explain the robustness. We demonstrate that networks with a higher average degree are often more robust. For the degree centrality and Erdo\H{}s\textendash R\'enyi (ER) graphs, we present explicit formulas for the computation of the robustness, mainly based on the joint distribution of node degrees and degree changes which allow us to analyze the robustness for ER graphs with a constant average degree or increasing average degree.},

Although it is typically estimated as a single fixed quantity, previous work suggests that reliability can vary across persons, groups, and covariates. We propose a novel method for estimating and modeling case-specific reliability without repeated measurements or parallel tests. The proposed method employs a ``Reliability Factor'' that models the error variance of each case across multiple indicators, thereby producing case-specific reliability estimates. Additionally, we use Gaussian process modeling to a estimate non-linear, non-monotonic function between the latent factor itself and the reliability of the measure, providing an analogue to test information functions in item response theory. The reliability factor model is a new tool for examining latent regions with poor conditional reliability, and correlates thereof, in a classical test theory framework.},

The study was performed on university students (n = 1237) who were asked to fill in the SVS \cyrchar\cyri PVQ Schwartz's questionnaires. The sample was then treated with the K-means cluster analysis, which resulted in the division of the initial sample into three subgroups or clusters according to their values hierarchy being measured separately at the (1) Normative Ideals scale and (2) the scale of Behavioral Priorities. These clusters were equally common among male and female students, but they were unequally found in young people coming from different ethnic groups and regions, demonstrating the role of socio-cultural environment in building up personal values.

In spite of previous works, to fully reconstruct the network structure from observed binary data remains challenging. We articulate a statistical inference based approach to this problem. In particular, exploiting the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, we develop a method to ascertain the neighbors of any node in the network based solely on binary data, thereby recovering the full topology of the network. A key ingredient of our method is the maximum-likelihood estimation of the probabilities associated with actual or nonexistent links, and we show that the EM algorithm can distinguish the two kinds of probability values without any ambiguity, insofar as the length of the available binary time series is reasonably long. Our method does not require any a priori knowledge of the detailed dynamical processes, is parameter-free, and is capable of accurate reconstruction even in the presence of noise. We demonstrate the method using combinations of distinct types of binary dynamical processes and network topologies, and provide a physical understanding of the underlying reconstruction mechanism. Our statistical inference based reconstruction method contributes an additional piece to the rapidly expanding ``toolbox'' of data based reverse engineering of complex networked systems.},

The opinion of an agent is a continuous positive value, denoting its subjective answer to a factual question. The wisdom of crowds states that the average of all opinions is close to the truth, i.e. the correct answer. But if agents have the chance to adjust their opinion in response to the opinions of others, this effect can be destroyed. Our model investigates this scenario by evaluating two competing effects: (i) agents tend to keep their own opinion (individual conviction \$\textbackslash beta\$), (ii) they tend to adjust their opinion if they have information about the opinions of others (social influence \$\textbackslash alpha\$). For the latter, two different regimes (full information vs. aggregated information) are compared. Our simulations show that social influence only in rare cases enhances the wisdom of crowds. Most often, we find that agents converge to a collective opinion that is even farther away from the true answer. So, under social influence the wisdom of crowds can be systematically wrong.},

At the local level, I find that differences in the opposition's strength incentivize governments to use restrictions to demobilize opponents where they are strongest, target marginal districts during local elections, and maintain dominance in their strongholds. At the national level, I show that as threats to the government party's primacy increase, so does the effect of local electoral competition on the hazard of restrictions.},

  abstract = {Evolutionary game theory is a foundational, if somewhat idealized, tool for modeling the natural selection of frequency-dependent traits in populations. In addition to modeling fecundity that can be influenced by the behaviors of others, this framework has also come to incorporate many varieties of demographic heterogeneity, most notably that of a population's spatial structure. Given the sophistication of current models of population dynamics, one of the most difficult obstacles lies in making analytical deductions, either qualitative or quantitative, about the long-term outcomes of an evolutionary process. The "structure coefficient theorem" is a well-known approach to this problem for mutation-selection processes under weak selection, but a general method of evaluating the terms it comprises is still lacking. Here we provide such a method for populations of fixed (but arbitrary) size and structure, using easily interpretable measures of population heterogeneity. This method encompasses a large family of evolutionary update mechanisms, and it includes complexity bounds in terms of the population size. We apply the method to the case of social goods produced and distributed among individuals in spatially-heterogeneous populations. We show that the outcome of selection varies dramatically depending on how goods are produced and distributed, on the details of population structure, and on the rate of mutation.},

  abstract = {Over the last two decades, alongside the increased availability of large network datasets, we have witnessed the rapid rise of network science. For many systems, however, the data we have access to is not a direct description of the underlying network. More and more, we see the drive to study networks that have been inferred or reconstructed from non-network data---in particular, using time series data from the nodes in a system to infer likely connections between them. Selecting the most appropriate technique for this task is a challenging problem in network science. Different reconstruction techniques usually have different assumptions, and their performance varies from system to system in the real world. One way around this problem could be to use several different reconstruction techniques and compare the resulting networks. However, network comparison is also not an easy problem, as it is not obvious how best to quantify the differences between two networks, in part because of the diversity of tools for doing so. The netrd Python package seeks to address these two parallel problems in network science by providing, to our knowledge, the most extensive collection of both network reconstruction techniques and network comparison techniques (often referred to as graph distances) in a single library (https://github.com/netsiphd/netrd). In this article, we detail the two main functionalities of the netrd package. Along the way, we describe some of its other useful features. This package builds on commonly used Python packages and is already a widely used resource for network scientists and other multidisciplinary researchers. With ongoing open-source development, we see this as a tool that will continue to be used by all sorts of researchers to come.},

  abstract = {Sociological theories of morality have grown in prevalence over the last decade and a half. These theories often focus on developing single concepts such as identity, reputation or emotion, or they provide sweeping historical accounts. Such theories often also take the construct of empathy for granted, as an inevitable consequence of morality. Here, I present a mechanistic theory of empathy which operates at multiple levels of analysis. The approach offered can help frame particular topics in the sociology of morality, though it is also robust enough to analyse historical change. Specifically, the theory presented here is composed of sets of situational, structural and societal mechanisms. Each set is discussed, as well as their relation to one another, before turning to an explication of how the present theory relates to a selective sampling of prominent theories in the contemporary sociology of morality.},

The results show that a network model provided better fit to matrices of partial correlations but latent variable models provided better fit to matrices of full correlations. This result is due to the fact that the use of partial correlations removes most of the covariance common to WAIS-IV tests. Modeling should be based on uncorrected correlations since these represent the majority of shared variance between WAIS-IV test scores.},

We argue that there also is utility in studying how configurations of four actors, or tetrads, pattern our social world. The current project considers the prevalence of directed tetrads across twenty social networks representing five relationship types (friendship, legislative co-sponsorship, Twitter, advice seeking, and email). By comparing these observed networks to randomly generated conditional networks, we identify tetrads that occur more frequently than expected, or network motifs. In all twenty networks, we find evidence for six tetrad motifs that collectively highlight tendencies toward hierarchy, clustering, and bridging in social interaction. Variations across network genres also emerge, suggesting that unique tetrad structural signatures could define different types of interaction.},

Recent work has shown the advantage of including predictors for both the mean (the location submodel) and the variability (the scale submodel) within a single model. Constrained versions of the model can be fit in standard mixed effect model software, but the most general version with random effects in each of the location and scale submodels has been noted for being difficult to fit and estimate in software. However, the latest release of Mplus includes new capabilities that facilitate fitting the general version of the model as a multilevel structural equation model (SEM). This article introduces the general form of the model that includes location and scale random effects (called the location-scale model) and notes how it can be envisioned as a multilevel SEM. We provide a tutorial with example analyses and Mplus code for the model with two-level cross-sectional data and three-level repeated measures data and discuss how such a model has potential to extend recent developments in organizational science.},

At the same time, the molecule is converted to a form of limited solubility, which is precipitated at low pH, where activation is normally seen. The results are interpreted in terms of the peculiar structure of the pepsinogen molecule. Titration of the basic NH2-terminal region produced an open form, which can return to the native form at neutral pH, but which is maintained at low pH by neutralization of carboxylate groups in the pepsin portion.},

This method utilises permutations of initial adjacency matrix assemblies that conform to the prescribed in-degree sequence, yet violate the given out-degree sequence. It combines directed edge-swapping and constrained Monte-Carlo edge-mixing for improving approximations to the given out-degree sequence until it is exactly matched. Our method permits inclusion or exclusion of `multi-edges', allowing assembly of weighted or binary networks. It further allows prescribing the overall percentage of such multiple connections\textemdash permitting exploration of a weighted synthetic network space unlike any other method currently available for comparison of real-world networks with controlled multi-edge proportion null spaces. The graph space is sampled by the method non-uniformly, yet the algorithm provides weightings for the sample space across all possible realisations allowing computation of statistical averages of network metrics as if they were sampled uniformly. Given a sequence of in- and out- degrees, the method can also produce simple graphs for sequences that satisfy conditions of graphicality. Our method successfully builds networks with order O(107) edges on the scale of minutes with a laptop running Matlab. We provide our implementation of the method on the GitHub repository for immediate use by the research community, and demonstrate its application to three real-world networks for null-space comparisons as well as the study of dynamics of neuronal networks.},

Furthermore, reciprocal edges to newly added nodes are established according to a response mechanism. The proposed framework extends previous mixed attachment models by allowing the number of new edges to vary according to various discrete probability distributions, including Poisson, Binomial, Zeta, and Log-Series. We derive analytical expressions for the limit in-degree distribution that results from the mixed attachment and response mechanisms. Moreover, we describe the evolution of the dynamics of the cumulative in-degree distribution. Simulation results illustrate how the number of new edges and the process of reciprocity significantly impact the head of the degree distribution.},

Although the platform is known for having users posting videos of themselves dancing, lip-syncing, or showcasing other talents, user-videos expressing political views have seen a recent spurt. This study aims to perform a primary evaluation of political communication on TikTok. We collect a set of US partisan Republican and Democratic videos to investigate how users communicated with each other about political issues. With the help of computer vision, natural language processing, and statistical tools, we illustrate that political communication on TikTok is much more interactive in comparison to other social media platforms, with users combining multiple information channels to spread their messages. We show that political communication takes place in the form of communication trees since users generate branches of responses to existing content. In terms of user demographics, we find that users belonging to both the US parties are young and behave similarly on the platform. However, Republican users generated more political content and their videos received more responses; on the other hand, Democratic users engaged significantly more in cross-partisan discussions.},

We show numerically and analytically that the observer's resulting opinions are highly inconsistent (they tend to be independent of the observer's initial opinions) and unstable (they exhibit wide stochastic variations). Opinion inconsistency and instability increase with the world complexity represented by the number of subjects, which can be prevented by suitably expanding the observer's initial amount of information. Our findings imply that even an individual who initially trusts credible information sources may end up trusting the deceptive ones if at least a small number of trust relations exist between the credible and deceptive sources.},

Results also~indicate that social learning practices, or at least the ones considered in this study, are not necessary conditions (anymore) for parent\textendash child correspondence. Frequency of cue-giving in the form of direct communication is important to internalize parental~attitudes but political sophistication and consistency in cue-giving less so.

To understand the effectiveness of dynamic properties in the evaluation of reputation, we propose our own model (DIB-RM) that utilizes three factors: forgetting, cumulative, and activity period. In order to evaluate the model, we use data from StackOverflow which also has its own reputation model. We estimate similarity of ratings between DIB-RM and the StackOverflow reputation model to test our hypothesis. We use two values to calculate our metrics: DIB-RM reputation and historical reputation. We found out that historical reputation gives better metric values. Our preliminary results are presented for different sets of values of the aforementioned factors in order to analyze how effectively the model can be used for modeling reputation systems.},

Understanding the evolution of communities is useful in many applications, such as building successful communities, maintaining the success of communities, etc. There have been some works on studying online communities such as understanding the life cycle of users and understanding the loyalty of members in a community. An aspect of online community studies that has not been sufficiently studied is the evolution of communities over time. In this work, we investigate factors that significantly differentiate the different parts of the evolution of communities. Firstly, we identify the different patterns that can exist in the evolution of communities. Next, we examine how different features differentiate parts of the patterns identified. Experimental results showed that the linguistic style of users who make posts and the interaction dynamics of members in a community are related to different parts of communities' evolution with respect to the number of active users.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Online social networks are often subject to influence campaigns by malicious actors through the use of automated accounts known as bots. We consider the problem of detecting bots in online social networks and assessing their impact on the opinions of individuals. We begin by analyzing the behavior of bots in social networks and identify that they exhibit heterophily, meaning they interact with humans more than other bots. We use this property to develop a detection algorithm based on the Ising model from statistical physics. The bots are identified by solving a minimum cut problem. We show that this Ising model algorithm can identify bots with higher accuracy while utilizing much less data than other state of the art methods. {$<$}/p{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}We then develop a a function we call generalized harmonic influence centrality to estimate the impact bots have on the opinions of users in social networks. This function is based on a generalized opinion dynamics model and captures how the activity level and network connectivity of the bots shift equilibrium opinions. To apply generalized harmonic influence centrality to real social networks, we develop a deep neural network to measure the opinions of users based on their social network posts. Using this neural network, we then calculate the generalized harmonic influence centrality of bots in multiple real social networks. For some networks we find that a limited number of bots can cause non-trivial shifts in the population opinions. In other networks, we find that the bots have little impact. Overall we find that generalized harmonic influence centrality is a useful operational tool to measure the impact of bots in social networks. {$<$}/p{$>$}},

The game of football (soccer) provides a wealth of real world data with which to quantify managers' use of personal and social information in selecting team formations. I analyse a 5-year dataset of all games (n=9127, 2012-2017) in the five top European leagues (English Premier League, German Bundesliga, Spanish La Liga, French Ligue 1 and Italian Serie A) to quantify the extent to which a manager's initial match formation is guided by their personal past use or success with that formation, or other managers' use or success with that formation. I focus in particular on the use of the 4231 formation, which was the dominant formation at the start of this period but showed a gradual decline in use over time. I find that, as predicted, a manager's choice of whether to use 4231 or not is influenced by both their recent use of 4231 (personal information) and the use of 4231 in the entire population of managers in that division (social information). Contrary to expectations, managers appeared to rely more on personal than social information, although this estimate was highly variable across managers and divisions. Serie A managers, in particular, showed a much stronger use of personal information, likely due to the rarity of 4231 in that division. Finally, there did not appear to be an adaptive tradeoff between social and personal information use, with the relative reliance on each failing to predict managerial success.},

  abstract = {The spread of influence in networks is a topic of great importance in many application areas. For instance, one would like to maximise the coverage, limiting the budget for marketing campaign initialisation and use the potential of social influence. To tackle this and similar challenges, more than a decade ago, researchers started to investigate the influence maximisation problem. The challenge is to find the best set of initially activated seed nodes in order to maximise the influence spread in networks. In typical approach we will activate all seeds in single stage, at the beginning of the process, while in this work we introduce and evaluate a new approach for seeds activation in temporal networks based on sequential seeding. Instead of activating all nodes at the same time, this method distributes the activations of seeds, leading to higher ranges of influence spread. The results of experiments performed using real and randomised networks demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms single stage seeding in 71\% of cases by nearly 6\% on average. Knowing that temporal networks are an adequate choice for modelling dynamic processes, the results of this work can be interpreted as encouraging to apply temporal sequential seeding for real world cases, especially knowing that more sophisticated seed selection strategies can be implemented by using the seed activation strategy introduced in this work.},

Relative to these approaches, we show that the AME approach is (a) to be easy to implement; (b) interpretable in a general linear model framework; (c) computationally straightforward; (d) not prone to degeneracy; (e) captures first-, second-, and third-order network dependencies; and (f) notably outperforms ERGMs and LSMs on a variety of metrics and in an out-of-sample context.

  abstract = {In manifest variable models, Bayesian methods for mediation analysis can have better statistical properties than commonly used frequentist methods. However, with latent variables, Bayesian mediation analysis with diffuse priors can yield worse statistical properties than frequentist methods, and no study to date has evaluated the impact of informative priors on statistical properties of point and interval summaries of the mediated effect. This article describes the first examination of using fully conjugate and informative (accurate and inaccurate) priors in Bayesian mediation analysis with latent variables. Results suggest that fully conjugate priors and informative priors with the same relative prior sample sizes have notably different effects at \emph{N}\,=\,200 and 400, than at \emph{N}\,=\,50 and 100. Consequences of a small amount of inaccuracy in priors for loadings can be alleviated by making the prior less informative, whereas the same is not always true of inaccuracy in priors for structural paths. Finally, the consequences of using informative priors depend on the inferential goals of the analysis: inaccurate priors are more detrimental for accurately estimating the mediated effect than for evaluating whether the mediated effect is nonzero. Recommendations are provided about when to gainfully employ Bayesian mediation analysis with latent variables.},

  abstract = {Hate speech is an important problem in the management of user generated content. In order to remove offensive content or ban misbehaving users, content moderators need reliable hate speech detectors. Recently, deep neural networks based on transformer architecture, such as (multilingual) BERT model, achieve superior performance in many natural language classification tasks, including hate speech detection. So far, these methods have not been able to quantify their output in terms of reliability. We propose a Bayesian method using Monte Carlo Dropout within the attention layers of the transformer models to provide well-calibrated reliability estimates. We evaluate and visualize the introduced approach on hate speech detection problems in several languages. From the experiments performed it was observed that our approach significantly improve the hate speech detection that can not be trusted. Our approach not only improves classification performance of the state-of-the-art multilingual BERT model, but the computed reliability scores also significantly reduce the workload in inspection of offending cases and in reannotation campaigns. The provided visualization helps to understand the borderline outcomes.},

Cooperation can be favored when the mobility of individuals allows cooperators to form a cluster (or group). Mobility patterns of animals sometimes follow a Le\textasciiacute vy flight. A Le\textasciiacute vy flight is a kind of random walk but it is composed of many small movements with a few big movements. Here, we developed an agent-based model in a square lattice where agents perform Le\textasciiacute vy flights depending on the fraction of neighboring defectors. We focus on how the sensitivity to defectors when performing Le\textasciiacute vy flights promotes the evolution of cooperation. Results of evolutionary simulations showed that cooperation was most promoted when the sensitivity to defectors was moderate. As the population density became larger, higher sensitivity was more beneficial for cooperation to evolve.},

Researchers interested in prediction generally favor flexible, robust approaches, while those interested in causation are often interested in modeling nuanced treatment structures and confounding relationships.

We also improve uncertainty estimates for the model's average marginal effect estimates\textemdash which we test both in simulation and in practice\textemdash and introduce new visual and statistical tools designed to assist with inference under the model. We further demonstrate the value of our improvements through an analysis of the 2016 presidential election, an analysis that would have been impractical or even infeasible for many users with existing software.},

  abstract = {Online hate speech is a newborn problem in our modern society which is growing at a steady rate exploiting weaknesses of the corresponding regimes that characterise several social media platforms. Therefore, this phenomenon is mainly cultivated through such comments, either during users' interaction or on posted multimedia context. Nowadays, giant companies own platforms where many millions of users log in daily. Thus, protection of their users from exposure to similar phenomena for keeping up with the corresponding law, as well as for retaining a high quality of offered services, seems mandatory. Having a robust and reliable mechanism for identifying and preventing the uploading of related material would have a huge effect on our society regarding several aspects of our daily life. On the other hand, its absence would deteriorate heavily the total user experience, while its erroneous operation might raise several ethical issues. In this work, we present a protocol for creating a more suitable dataset, regarding its both informativeness and representativeness aspects, favouring the safer capture of hate speech occurrence, without at the same time restricting its applicability to other classification problems. Moreover, we produce and publish a textual dataset with two variants: binary and multi-label, called `ETHOS', based on YouTube and Reddit comments validated through figure-eight crowdsourcing platform. Our assumption about the production of more compatible datasets is further investigated by applying various classification models and recording their behaviour over several appropriate metrics.},

Short-term effects are modeled by activation patterns due to parallel constraint satisfaction processes, and long-term effects are modeled by weight changes due to the settling patterns of activation. Phenomena modeled include thought-induced attitude polarization, elaboration and attitude strength, motivated reasoning and social influence, an integrated view of heuristic versus systematic persuasion, and implicit versus explicit attitude change. Results of the simulations are consistent with empirical results. The same set of simple mechanisms is used to model all the phenomena, which allows the model to offer a parsimonious theoretical account of how structure can impact attitude change.

  abstract = {Model fit indices are being increasingly recommended and used to select the number of factors in an exploratory factor analysis. Growing evidence suggests that the recommended cutoff values for common model fit indices are not appropriate for use in an exploratory factor analysis context. A particularly prominent problem in scale evaluation is the ubiquity of correlated residuals and imperfect model specification. Our research focuses on a scale evaluation context and the performance of four standard model fit indices: root mean square error of approximate (RMSEA), standardized root mean square residual (SRMR), comparative fit index (CFI), and Tucker\textendash Lewis index (TLI), and two equivalence test-based model fit indices: RMSEAt and CFIt. We use Monte Carlo simulation to generate and analyze data based on a substantive example using the positive and negative affective schedule ( N = 1,000). We systematically vary the number and magnitude of correlated residuals as well as nonspecific misspecification, to evaluate the impact on model fit indices in fitting a two-factor exploratory factor analysis. Our results show that all fit indices, except SRMR, are overly sensitive to correlated residuals and nonspecific error, resulting in solutions that are overfactored. SRMR performed well, consistently selecting the correct number of factors; however, previous research suggests it does not perform well with categorical data. In general, we do not recommend using model fit indices to select number of factors in a scale evaluation framework.},

Our analysis, based on both analytical and numerical results, shows a rich diagram of preferences and degree-dependencies of allocations to zealots and normal agents varying with the budget. We find that when we have a large budget or for low levels of zealotry, optimal strategies should give larger allocations to zealots and allocations are positively correlated with node degree. In contrast, for low budgets or highly-biased zealots, optimal strategies give higher allocations to normal agents, with some residual allocations to zealots, and allocations to both types of agents decrease with node degree. Our results emphasize that heterogeneity in agent properties strongly affects strategies for influence maximization on heterogeneous networks.},

Using an ecological linear growth model, this study tests these two concurrent positions with data from the first six rounds of the European Social Survey (ESS). This study focuses on the links between socio-economic conditions and inclusive social capital climates, i.e. social climates where inclusive attitudes and generalised trust are widely extended to outgroups. Two models are estimated with Bayesian methods and then compared. The results support the hypothesis that the diffusion of inclusive social capital climates can predict the improvement of a country's socio-economic conditions. However, they also support the opposite hypothesis, according to which the improvement of socio-economic conditions is pivotal in creating a climate of trust. Slightly stronger results are found for the latter hypothesis, suggesting that the enhancement of economic conditions and income distribution may be pivotal in reinforcing the social fabric.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

We put forward specific recommendations such as publishing findings with minimum a priori aggregation and exploring the limits of predictive models without being constrained by parsimony and intuitiveness but instead maximising out-of-sample predictive accuracy. We argue that naturally-occurring variance in many decontextualized and multi-determined constructs that interest personality scientists may not have individual causes, at least as this term is generally understood and in ways that are human-interpretable, never mind intervenable. If so, useful explanations are narratives that summarize many pieces of descriptive findings rather than models that target individual cause-effect associations. By meticulously studying specific and contextualized behaviours, thoughts, feelings and goals, however, individual causes of variance may ultimately be identifiable, although such causal explanations will likely be far more complex, phenomenon-specific and personspecific than anticipated thus far. Progress in all three areas \textendash{} description, prediction, and explanation \textendash{} requires higherdimensional models than the currently-dominant ``Big Few'' and supplementing subjective trait-ratings with alternative sources of information such as informant-reports and behavioural measurements. Developing a new generation of psychometric tools thus provides many immediate research opportunities.},

  abstract = {Background:Temporal complexity refers to qualities of a time series that are emergent, erratic, or not easily described by linear processes. Quantifying temporal complexity within a system is key to understanding the time based dynamics of said system. However, many current methods of complexity quantification are not widely used due to their technical difficulty, computational intensity, or large number of required data samples. These requirements impede the study of complexity in areas of research such as behavioral science and mental health. A method is presented, tangle, which overcomes these difficulties and allows for complexity quantification in relatively short time series, such as those typically obtained by these research areas. Tangle is a measure of how dissimilar a given process is from simple periodic motion. Methods:Tangle is derived from an iterative scaling and untangling procedure. This procedure relies on the use of a 3-dimensional time delay embedding of a 1-dimensional time series. This embedding is then iteratively scaled and premultiplied by a modified upshift matrix until a convergence criterion is reached. Results:Systems studied are: (A) random noise, (B) a Lorenz attractor, (C) a Rossler attractor, (D) a Hindmarsh-Rose neuron model, and (E) a noisy sine wave. An example application of tangle for studying mental health is given using emotional stability and anxiety time series data obtained from 65 socially anxious participants over a five-week period. Simulation results show tangle is able to distinguish between different complex temporal systems in time series with as few as 50 samples. Conclusions:Tangle shows promise as a reliable quantification of irregular behavior of a time series. Unlike many other complexity quantification metrics, tangle is technically simple to implement and is able to uncover meaningful information about time series derived from behavioral and mental health research studies. Future work should focus on comparing tangle to other temporal complexity metrics and seek to optimize convergence.},

Recent studies on simple reputation systems for e-Businesses such as eBay have pointed to the importance of such rating systems for deterring moral hazard and encouraging trusting interactions. However, despite numerous studies on trust and reputation systems, few have taken studies across disciplines to provide an integrated account of these concepts and their relationships. This paper first surveys existing literatures on trust, reputation and a related concept: reciprocity. Based on sociological and biological understandings of these concepts, a computational model is proposed. This model can be implemented in a real system to consistently calculate agents' trust and reputation scores.},

This development is due to the flexibility of the Bayes factor for testing multiple hypotheses simultaneously, the ability to test complex hypotheses involving equality as well as order constraints on the parameters of interest, and the interpretability of the outcome as the weight of evidence provided by the data in support of competing scientific theories. The available software tools for Bayesian hypothesis testing are still limited however. In this paper we present a new R-package called BFpack that contains functions for Bayes factor hypothesis testing for the many common testing problems. The software includes novel tools (i) for Bayesian exploratory testing (null vs positive vs negative effects), (ii) for Bayesian confirmatory testing (competing hypotheses with equality and/or order constraints), (iii) for common statistical analyses, such as linear regression, generalized linear models, (multivariate) analysis of (co)variance, correlation analysis, and random intercept models, (iv) using default priors, and (v) while allowing data to contain missing observations that are missing at random.},

A generalization was proposed by Verdinelli and Wasserman (1995) such that the priors can be freely specified under both hypotheses while keeping the computational advantage. This paper presents an extension of this generalization when the hypothesis has equality as well as order constraints on the parameters of interest. The methodology is used for a constrained multivariate t test using the JZS Bayes factor and a constrained hypothesis test under the multinomial model.},

An example is that, when performing a t test using standard conjugate priors, the Bayes factor of the alternative hypothesis to the null hypothesis remains bounded as the t statistic grows to infinity. The goal of this paper is to thoroughly investigate information inconsistency in various Bayesian testing problems. We consider precise hypothesis tests, one-sided hypothesis tests, and multiple hypothesis tests under normal linear models with dependent observations. Standard priors are considered, such as conjugate and semi-conjugate priors, as well as variations of Zellner's g prior (e.g., fixed g priors, mixtures of g priors, and adaptive (data-based) g priors). It is shown that information inconsistency is a widespread problem using standard priors while certain theoretically recommended priors, including scale mixtures of conjugate priors and adaptive priors, are information consistent.},

Moreover, on the online setting the network is given as a stream of higher order structures, i.e., triangles of nodes to be clustered into communities.In this paper, we propose an on online local graph community detection algorithm that uses motifs, such as triangles of nodes. We provide experimental results and compare it to another algorithm named COEUS. We use two public datasets, one of Amazon data and the other of DBLP data. Furthermore, we create and experiment on a new dataset that consists of web pages and their links by using the Internet Archive. This latter dataset provides insights to better understand how working with motifs is different than working with edges.},

  abstract = {Complex human cognition arises from the integrated processing of multiple brain systems. However, little is known about how brain systems and their interactions might relate to, or perhaps even explain, human cognitive capacities. Here, we address this gap in knowledge by proposing a mechanistic framework linking frontoparietal system activity, default mode system activity, and the interactions between them, with individual differences in working memory capacity. We show that working memory performance depends on the strength of functional interactions between the frontoparietal and default mode systems. We find that this strength is modulated by the activation of two newly described brain regions, and demonstrate that the functional role of these systems is underpinned by structural white matter. Broadly, our study presents a holistic account of how regional activity, functional connections, and structural linkages together support integrative processing across brain systems in order for the brain to execute a complex cognitive process.},

We attempt to overcome these obstacles, offering a ``synthetic'' forecasting model for Danish national election outcomes, 1964\textendash 2015. The regression model, based on the variables of economic growth and vote intention, performs well, by various tests. Finally, we apply it, ex ante fashion, to the 2019 contest, where the prediction favored the Social Democratic led coalition, an outcome that came to pass.},

To address this problem, we provide a method for estimating continuous trust /distrust value between unconnected users. Our method is based on co-citation and transpose trust propagation. We determine on average how differently two users trust or are trusted by other users, and how differently a user trusts another user from how it is trusted by that user. Using these differences, we estimate four partial trust estimates and compute the final trust value from trustor to trustee as the weighted average of these partial estimates. We propose a basic framework that maximizes accuracy, robustness and coverage and show how we can further improve the accuracy at a lower coverage. We perform experiments on real world trust related networks that show that our proposed method outperforms recent state of the art trust computation methods in terms of accuracy and robustness on commonly used datasets.},

Less studied, however, is the question of how voters arrive at parties' left-right positions and how parties can influence voter perceptions. In this article, I demonstrate that parties can shape voter understandings of the content of their left-right position by using three strategies: avoidance, ambivalence, or ambiguity. Specifically, a party may avoid or de-emphasize a given issue, embrace a conflicting position, or becloud its position on the issue in electoral campaigns to induce the voter to place less weight on this issue when perceiving the party's left-right position. To test these hypotheses, the analysis connects voter data from the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems with party data from the Comparative Manifesto Project and the Chapel Hill Expert Survey in 13 West European Countries and finds empirical support for the effectiveness of these strategies.},

Departing from the more common inference of a single graph and motivated by social and biological networks, we study the problem of jointly inferring multiple graphs from the observation of signals at their nodes (graph signals), which are assumed to be stationary in the sought graphs. From a mathematical point of view, graph stationarity implies that the mapping between the covariance of the signals and the sparse matrix representing the underlying graph is given by a matrix polynomial. A prominent example is that of Markov random fields, where the inverse of the covariance yields the sparse matrix of interest. From a modeling perspective, stationary graph signals can be used to model linear network processes evolving on a set of (not necessarily known) networks. Leveraging that matrix polynomials commute, a convex optimization method along with sufficient conditions that guarantee the recovery of the true graphs are provided when perfect covariance information is available. Particularly important from an empirical viewpoint, we provide high-probability bounds on the recovery error as a function of the number of signals observed and other key problem parameters. Numerical experiments using synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method with perfect covariance information as well as its robustness in the noisy regime.},

Since chaotic systems are so hard to understand analytically, numerical simulations assume a key role in their investigation. Such simulations have been considered as reproducible in many works. However, few studies have focused on the effects of the finite precision of computers on the simulation reproducibility of chaotic systems; moreover, code sharing and details on how to reproduce simulation results are not present in many investigations. In this work, a case study of reproducibility is presented in the simulation of a chaotic jerk circuit, using the software LTspice. We also employ the OSF platform to share the project associated with this paper. Tests performed with LTspice XVII on four different computers show the difficulties of simulation reproducibility by this software. We compare these results with experimental data using a normalised root mean square error in order to identify the computer with the highest prediction horizon. We also calculate the entropy of the signals to check differences among computer simulations and the practical experiment. The methodology developed is efficient in identifying the computer with better performance, which allows applying it to other cases in the literature. This investigation is fully described and available on the OSF platform.},

Research has repeatedly demonstrated that ``electoral winners'' (i.e. voters casting a ballot for government parties) are more satisfied with democracy than supporters of the opposition parties. However, little is known about the dynamics of satisfaction during the electoral cycle: Do winners become happier and losers even more discontent over time? We approach this question by utilizing an interview date in the European Social Survey (rounds 1\textendash 8) to position individuals within the different stages of electoral cycle. The results based on 199,207 responses from 199 surveys in 31 countries suggest that satisfaction with democracy stays relatively stable during the electoral cycle across various electoral systems if the political development is predictable. However, if actions of the parties are uncertain, namely the alternations of governments tend to be frequent, partial, and opened to all parties, and hence neither winners nor losers know how steady their status is with respect to the political development in the country, their satisfaction tend to fluctuate over time. Therefore, the conclusion reached is the more stable West European democracies have limited generalizability to the low-predictable systems in Central and Eastern Europe.},

It exists when the legislature is divided into two equally legitimate             parts, only one of which can dismiss the prime minister in a no-confidence vote. This             system has distinct advantages over pure parliamentary and presidential systems: it             establishes a branch-based separation of powers and can balance the `majoritarian'             and `proportional' visions of democracy without concentrating executive power in a             single individual. This article analyses bicameral versions of semi-parliamentary             government in Australia and Japan, and compares empirical patterns of democracy in             the Australian Commonwealth as well as New South Wales to 20 advanced parliamentary             and semi-presidential systems. It discusses new semi-parliamentary designs, some of             which do not require formal bicameralism, and pays special attention to semi-parliamentary             options for democratising the European Union.          {$<$}/p{$>$}},

In the context of LASSO regression, we repeatedly assign independently-drawn standard-exponential random weights to terms in the objective function, and optimize to obtain the surrogate samples. We establish the asymptotic properties of this me{$\surd$}thod under different regularization parameters {$\lambda$}n. In particular, if {$\lambda$}n = o( n), then the random-weighting (weighted bootstrap) samples are equivalent (up to the first order) to the Bayesian posterior samples. If {$\lambda$}n = O (nc) for some 1/2 {$<$} c {$<$} 1, then these samples achieve conditional model selection consistency. We also establish the asymptotic properties of the random-weighting method when weights are drawn from other distributions, and also if weights are assigned to the LASSO penalty terms.},

To address this issue, we constructed a new hybrid network model based on scale-free (SF), small-world (SW) features that functions as closely as possible to a real network. And the hybrid propagation model is constructed with susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS), susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) and susceptible-infected-recovered-susceptible (SIRS) model mixed in arbitrary proportions. The model applies the concepts of blockbuster effect and implicit node edges to reflect explosive spread as a significant characteristic of information propagation. A theoretical analysis and derivation of the new model in which hybrid networks were simulated revealed that the network degree distribution closely follows a power law. Using an improved similarity function to define the degree of closeness to real network cases, the proposed model was shown to be valid and very close to a real network.},

  abstract = {It is generally known that the factors in the common factor model (CFM) cannot be solved for uniquely even if the factor model fits perfectly and the factor loadings are known. This indeterminacy of the factor variables (often referred to as `factor scores') stems from the fact that the CFM is a set of underdetermined linear equations that has more unknowns than equations\textemdash a situation which produces an infinity of alternative solutions. In the first section of this inquiry, factor indeterminacy for all factors, common and unique, is examined in the context of The Theory of Generalized Inverses (TGI). Casting factor indeterminacy in the context of TGI provides some simpler results than older approaches. It is shown, for example, that essentially all statistical properties of the infinity of solutions are summarized in the elements of a single, idempotent matrix\textemdash symbolized here as H. In the final section of this article, a psychometric view of indeterminacy is presented in which it is argued that the two causes of indeterminacy are low reliabilities and low communalities of the observed variables. It is shown that the diagonal elements of the matrix H are reliability coefficients; therefore, the Spearman-Brown equation can be brought to bear on how much indeterminacy can be reduced by repeated sampling from an Infinite Behavior Domain (IBD). A brief discussion is presented on the effects of factor indeterminacy in IRT models.},

The phenomena of opinion polarization, the spread of propaganda and fake news, and the manipulation of sentiment are of interest to large numbers of organizations and people, some of whom are resource rich. Whether it is the more nefarious players such as foreign governments that are attempting to sway elections or large corporations that are trying to bend sentiment -- often quite surreptitiously, or it is more open and above board, like researchers that want to spread the news of some finding or some business interest that wants to make a large group of people aware of genuinely helpful innovations that they are marketing, what is at stake is often significant. In this paper we review many of the classical, and some of the new, social interaction models aimed at understanding opinion dynamics. While the first papers studying opinion dynamics appeared over 60 years ago, there is still a great deal of room for innovation and exploration. We believe that the political climate and the extraordinary (even unprecedented) events in the sphere of politics in the last few years will inspire new interest and new ideas. It is our aim to help those interested researchers understand what has already been explored in a significant portion of the field of opinion dynamics. We believe that in doing this, it will become clear that there is still much to be done.},

In order to uncover communalities between heterogeneous data, the data is often harmonized by constructing a kernel and numerical integration is performed. In this study we propose a method for data integration in the framework of an undirected graphical model, where the nodes represent individual data sources of varying nature in terms of complexity and underlying distribution, and where the edges represent the partial correlation between two blocks of data. We propose a modified GLASSO for estimation of the graph, with a combination of cross-validation and extended Bayes Information Criterion for sparsity tuning. Furthermore, hierarchical clustering on the weighted consensus kernels from a fixed network is used to partitioning the samples into different classes. Simulations show increasing ability to uncover true edges with increasing sample size and             signal to noise             . Likewise, identification of non existing edges towards disconnected nodes is feasible. The framework is demonstrated for integration of longitudinal symptom burden data from the 2nd and 3rd year of life with 21 diseases precursors as well as the development of asthma and eczema at the age of 6 years from 403 children from the COPSAC2010 mother-child cohort, suggesting that maternal predisposition as well as being born preterm indirectly lead to higher risk of asthma via increased respiratory symptom burden.},

Part II summarizes the pros and cons of previous attempts at gauging and classifying party ideological values and issue positions in general, as well as recent studies seeking to classify populists as a distinct party family. Part III describes the research design employed to construct the Global Party Survey, replicating the methods of previous expert surveys but expanding coverage worldwide and including innovative measures of populist rhetoric. The new dataset, drawing upon estimates from 1,861 experts, covers 1,043 political parties in 163 countries around the globe (see www.GlobalPartySurvey.org). Part IV presents key results and a series of robustness tests confirming that the new estimates of ideological values and populist parties are consistently correlated with previous measures. The conclusion in Part V summarizes the results and considers the potential uses of the dataset for understanding populism as a global phenomenon.},

  abstract = {Functional and effective networks inferred from time series are at the core of network neuroscience. Since it is common practice to compare network properties between patients and controls, it is crucial for inferred network models to reflect key underlying structural properties. However, even a few spurious links severely distort the shortest-path length and derived measures including the small-world coefficient, providing misleading insights into the macroscopic topology of the network. This poses a challenge for functional connectomes based on correlation, whose transitivity necessarily induce numerous false positives. We study how false positives bias the properties of the networks inferred by bivariate and multivariate algorithms. Mutual information, bivariate transfer entropy, and multivariate transfer entropy are respectively used for inferring functional, directed-functional, and effective networks. The validation is performed on synthetic ground truth networks with 100--200 nodes and various topologies (regular lattice, small-world, random, scale-free, modular), as well as on a real macaque connectome. The time series of node activity are simulated via autoregressive dynamics. We find that multivariate transfer entropy captures key properties of all network structures for longer time series. Bivariate methods can achieve higher recall (sensitivity) for shorter time series; however, as available data increases, they are unable to control false positives (lower specificity). This leads to overestimated clustering, small-world, and rich-club coefficients, underestimated shortest path lengths and hub centrality, and fattened degree distribution tails. Caution should therefore be used when interpreting network properties of functional connectomes obtained via correlation or pairwise statistical dependence measures, rather than more holistic (yet data-hungry) multivariate models.},

In detail, connections are established between the KST simple learning model (SLM) and the IRT General Graded Response Model, and between the KST Basic Local Independence Model and IRT models in general. As a consequence, local independence is generalized to account for the existence of prerequisite relations between the items, IRT models become a subset of KST models, IRT likelihood functions can be generalized to broader families, and the issues of local dependence and dimensionality are partially disentangled. Models are discussed for both dichotomous and polytomous items and conclusions are drawn on their interpretation.

Previous extensions of PA have addressed this deficiency by either adding the notion of node fitness to PA, usually drawn from some fitness score distributions, or by using fitness alone to control attachment. Here we introduce a new dynamical approach to address late arrivals by adding a recent-degree-change bias to PA so that nodes with higher relative degree change in temporal proximity to an arriving node get an attachment probability boost. In other words, if PA describes a rich-get-richer mechanism, and fitness-based approaches describe good-get-richer mechanisms, then our model can be characterized as a hot-get-richer mechanism, where hotness is determined by the rate of degree change over some recent past. The proposed model produces much later high-ranking nodes than the PA model and, under certain parameters, produces networks with structure similar to PA networks.},

Collinearity statistics, average variance extracted, and an estimated partial least square regression model are evaluated to confirm independent meaning, correct construct measure and endogenous variable explanation by the predictive constructs.

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Ising models describe the joint probability distribution of a vector of binary feature variables. Typically, not all the variables interact with each other and one is interested in learning the presumably sparse network structure of the interacting variables. However, in the presence of latent variables, the conventional method of learning a sparse model might fail. This is because the latent variables induce indirect interactions of the observed variables. In the case of only a few latent conditional Gaussian variables these spurious interactions contribute an additional low-rank component to the interaction parameters of the observed Ising model. Therefore, we propose to learn a sparse + low-rank decomposition of the parameters of an Ising model using a convex regularized likelihood problem. We show that the same problem can be obtained as the dual of a maximum-entropy problem with a new type of relaxation, where the sample means collectively need to match the expected values only up to a given tolerance. The solution to the convex optimization problem has consistency properties in the high-dimensional setting, where the number of observed binary variables and the number of latent conditional Gaussian variables are allowed to grow with the number of training samples. {$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Ising models describe the joint probability distribution of a vector of binary feature variables. Typically, not all the variables interact with each other and one is interested in learning the presumably sparse network structure of the interacting variables. However, in the presence of latent variables, the conventional method of learning a sparse model might fail. This is because the latent variables induce indirect interactions of the observed variables. In the case of only a few latent conditional Gaussian variables these spurious interactions contribute an additional low-rank component to the interaction parameters of the observed Ising model. Therefore, we propose to learn a sparse + low-rank decomposition of the parameters of an Ising model using a convex regularized likelihood problem. We show that the same problem can be obtained as the dual of a maximum-entropy problem with a new type of relaxation, where the sample means collectively need to match the expected values only up to a given tolerance. The solution to the convex optimization problem has consistency properties in the high-dimensional setting, where the number of observed binary variables and the number of latent conditional Gaussian variables are allowed to grow with the number of training samples. {$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Latent variable models can only be compared across groups when these groups exhibit measurement equivalence or ``invariance,'' since otherwise substantive differences may be confounded with measurement differences. This article suggests examining directly whether measurement differences present could confound substantive analyses, by examining the expected parameter change (EPC)-interest. The EPC-interest approximates the change in parameters of interest that can be expected when freeing cross-group invariance restrictions. Monte Carlo simulations suggest that the EPC-interest approximates these changes well. Three empirical applications show that the EPC-interest can help avoid two undesirable situations: first, it can prevent unnecessarily concluding that groups are incomparable, and second, it alerts the user when comparisons of interest may still be invalidated even when the invariance model appears to fit the data.

  abstract = {We present a new method of learning a continuous occupancy field for use in robot navigation. Occupancy grid maps, or variants of, are possibly the most widely used and accepted method of building a map of a robot's environment. Various methods have been developed to learn continuous occupancy maps and have successfully resolved many of the shortcomings of grid mapping, namely, priori discretisation and spatial correlation. However, most methods for producing a continuous occupancy field remain computationally expensive or heuristic in nature. Our method explores a generalisation of the so-called Ising model as a suitable candidate for modelling an occupancy field. We also present a unique kernel for use within our method that models range measurements. The method is quite attractive as it requires only a small number of hyperparameters to be trained, and is computationally efficient. The small number of hyperparameters can be quickly learned by maximising a pseudo likelihood. The technique is demonstrated on both a small simulated indoor environment with known ground truth as well as large indoor and outdoor areas, using two common real data sets.},

However, these assumptions have been challenged as economic perceptions could be plagued by partisan bias. We use the comparative dataset of the European Social Survey to investigate partisan bias in the perception of economic performance. Firstly, we observe that the economic perceptions of both supporters and opponents of governing parties are strongly related to real-life economic indicators such as gross domestic product growth and unemployment levels. Secondly, we find that shifts in economic performance (growth and unemployment) are strongly associated with similar changes in economic perceptions among both supporters of governing parties and opposition parties. There is, however, a significant but limited partisan bias in economic perceptions in countries with high levels of unemployment.},

Secondary to removing the items, exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses revealed that the DS taps 3 dimensions of disgust: Core Disgust, Animal Reminder Disgust, and Contamination-Based Disgust. Women scored higher than men on the 3 disgust dimensions. Structural modeling provided support for the specificity of the 3-factor model, as Core Disgust and Contamination-Based Disgust were significantly predictive of obsessive- compulsive disorder (OCD) concerns, whereas Animal Reminder Disgust was not. Results from a clinical sample indicated that patients with OCD washing concerns scored significantly higher than patients with OCD without washing concerns on both Core Disgust and Contamination-Based Disgust, but not on Animal Reminder Disgust. These findings are discussed in the context of the refinement of the DS to promote a more psychometrically sound assessment of disgust sensitivity.

  pages = {49},
  abstract = {Background: Psychopathology research is changing focus from group-based `disease models' to a personalized approach inspired by complex systems theories. This approach, which has already produced novel and valuable insights into the complex nature of psychopathology, often relies on repeated self-ratings of individual patients. So far it has been unknown whether such self-ratings, the presumed observables of the individual patient as a complex system, actually display complex dynamics. We examine this basic assumption of a complex systems approach to psychopathology by testing repeated self-ratings for three markers of complexity: memory, the presence of (time-varying) short- and long-range temporal correlations, regime shifts, transitions between different dynamic regimes, and, sensitive dependence on initial conditions, also known as the `butterfly effect', the divergence of initially similar trajectories. Methods: We analysed repeated self-ratings (1,476 time points) from a single patient for the three markers of complexity using Bartels rank test, (partial) autocorrelation functions, timevarying autoregression, a non-stationarity test, change point analysis and the Sugihara-May algorithm. Results: Self-ratings concerning psychological states (e.g., the item `I feel down') exhibited all complexity markers: time-varying short- and long-term memory, multiple regime shifts and sensitive dependence on initial conditions. Unexpectedly, self-ratings concerning physical sensations (e.g., the item `I am hungry') exhibited less complex dynamics and their behaviour was more similar to random variables. Conclusions: Psychological self-ratings display complex dynamics. The presence of complexity in repeated self-ratings means that we have to acknowledge that (1) repeated selfratings yield a complex pattern of data and not a set of (nearly) independent data points, (2)},

The present study tested the hypothesis that destabilization is related to better treatment outcome. Method: 328 patients who received psychotherapy for mood disorders completed daily self-ratings about their psychotherapeutic process. A continuous measure of destabilization was defined as the relative strength of the highest peak in dynamic complexity, a measure for variability and turbulence, in the self-ratings of individual patients. Results: Destabilization was found to be related to better treatment outcome. When improvers and non-improvers were analyzed separately, destabilization was found to be related to better treatment outcome in improvers but not in non-improvers. Conclusions: Destabilization in daily self-ratings of the psychotherapeutic process is associated with better treatment outcome. The identification of destabilization periods in process-monitoring data is clinically relevant. During destabilization, patients are believed to be increasingly sensitive to the effects of therapy. Clinicians could tailor their interventions to these sensitive periods.},

Party system in Serbia is still not institutionalized, even after 25 years of the introduction of the multiparty system. Two-round majority system was applied in the first multiparty elec-tions, and since 1992 the proportional system with the threshold of 5\% and D'Hondt formula has been in force. Since 2011 Serbia has closed electoral lists and mandates are allocated by the predetermined order. However, after the last elections in 2014 the Parliament in Serbia will have around 20 political parties, unions and other organizations. These stakeholders appear on the electoral lists of the major political parties or in pre-electoral coalitions without graded elec-toral threshold and after entering the parliament form a separate parliamentary group, or distinguish themselves with their own identity, which leads to indirect parliamentarization and fragmentation of the parliament. This reflects on the complexity of the process of (coalition) government formation, but also on the functioning of the parliament. Frequent blackmails from the smaller political parties or changes in the behavior of actors reduce the predictability of actors' actions and slow down the consolidation of democracy in Serbia.},

  abstract = {Evolutionary clustering (EC) refers to the applications of evolutionary optimization algorithms such as genetic algorithm to data clustering. Although multi-objective evolutionary clustering algorithms were proposed to simultaneously consider different cluster properties such as compactness and separation, these techniques usually suffer from a reasonable initial population and a pre-defined number of clusters. Besides, the effectiveness of evolutionary operators is decreased in dealing with the clustering problem. On the other side, complex networks play an essential role in different fields of machine learning. In a complex network, points are considered as nodes, and the dataset is shown as a connected weighted graph. Also, complex networks tend to present a modular structure. This paper applies two concepts of complex networks including node centrality and community modularity to introduce a novel multi-objective evolutionary clustering. The proposed centrality modularity-based multi-objective evolutionary clustering (CMMOEC) takes the advantage of nodes similarity to find the best initial population of clustering solutions and provide new structural-based modularity to determine the optimal number of clusters automatically. Moreover, the proposed modularity is used to design a new recombination and mutation operator so that it generates offspring solutions that satisfy more diversity. Experiments carried out on several artificial and real-world datasets with different structures. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated by the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI). Simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm satisfies better performance in comparison to traditional methods.},

Overall, we find little empirical support for the claim. This is caused by significant reliability and validity problems related to measuring threat-sensitivity using electrodermal activity. When assesed reliably, electrodermal activity in the replications and published studies captures individual differences in the physiological changes associated with attention shifts, which are unrelated to ideology. In contrast to psychophysiological reactions, self-reported emotional reactions to threatening stimuli are reliably associated with ideology.},

The lens of discrete choice theory also provides several new tools for analyzing social network formation; for example, mixtures of existing models can be estimated by adapting known expectation-maximization algorithms, and the significance of node features can be evaluated in a statistically rigorous manner. We demonstrate the flexibility of our framework through examples that analyze a number of synthetic and real-world datasets. For example, we provide rigorous methods for estimating preferential attachment models and show how to separate the effects of preferential attachment and triadic closure. Non-parametric estimates of the importance of degree show a highly linear trend, and we expose the importance of looking carefully at nodes with degree zero. Examining the formation of a large citation graph, we find evidence for an increased role of degree when accounting for age. {$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Many prediction problems on social networks, from recommendations to anomaly detection, can be approached by modeling network data as a sequence of relational events and then leveraging the resulting model for prediction. Conditional logit models of discrete choice are a natural approach to modeling relational events as "choices" in a framework that envelops and extends many long-studied models of network formation. The conditional logit model is simplistic, but it is particularly attractive because it allows for efficient consistent likelihood maximization via negative sampling, something that isn't true for mixed logit and many other richer models. The value of negative sampling is particularly pronounced because choice sets in relational data are often enormous. Given the importance of negative sampling, in this work we introduce a model simplification technique for mixed logit models that we call "de-mixing", whereby standard mixture models of network formation---particularly models that mix local and global link formation---are reformulated to operate their modes over disjoint choice sets. This reformulation reduces mixed logit models to conditional logit models, opening the door to negative sampling while also circumventing other standard challenges with maximizing mixture model likelihoods. To further improve scalability, we also study importance sampling for more efficiently selecting negative samples, finding that it can greatly speed up inference in both standard and de-mixed models. Together, these steps make it possible to much more realistically model network formation in very large graphs. We illustrate the relative gains of our improvements on synthetic datasets with known ground truth as well as a large-scale dataset of public transactions on the Venmo platform.},

  abstract = {Community detection is a fundamental problem in the analysis of complex networks. It is the analogue of clustering in network data mining. Within community detection methods, hierarchical algorithms are popular. However, their iterative nature and the need to recompute the structural properties used to split the network (i.e. edge betweenness in Girvan and Newman's algorithm), make them unsuitable for large network data sets. In this paper, we study how local structural network properties can be used as proxies to improve the efficiency of hierarchical community detection while, at the same time, achieving competitive results in terms of modularity. In particular, we study the potential use of the structural properties commonly used to perform local link prediction, a supervised learning problem where community structure is relevant, as nodes are prone to establish new links with other nodes within their communities. In addition, we check the performance impact of network pruning heuristics as an ancillary tactic to make hierarchical community detection more efficient},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}International migration implies the coexistence of different ethnic and cultural groups in the receiving country. The refugee crisis of 2015 has resulted in critical levels of opinion polarization on the question of whether to welcome migrants, causing clashes in receiving countries. This scenario emphasizes the need to better understand the dynamics of mutual adaptation between locals and migrants, and the conditions that favor successful integration. Agent-based simulations can help achieve this goal. In this work, we introduce our model MigrAgent and our preliminary results. The model synthesizes the dynamics of migration intake and post-migration adaptation. It explores the different acculturation outcomes that can emerge from the mutual adaptation of a migrant population and a local population depending on their degree of tolerance. With parameter sweeping, we detect how different acculturation strategies can coexist in a society and in different degrees among various subgroups. The results show higher polarization effects between a local population and a migrant population for fast intake conditions. When migrant intake is slow, transitory conditions between acculturation outcomes emerge for subgroups, e.g., from assimilation to integration for liberal migrants and from marginalization to separation for conservative migrants. Relative group sizes due to speed of intake cause counterintuitive scenarios, such as the separation of liberal locals. We qualitatively compare the processes of our model with the German portion sample of the survey Causes and Consequences of Socio-Cultural Integration Processes among New Immigrants in Europe (SCIP), finding preliminary confirmation of our assumptions and results. {$<$}/p{$>$}},

The considered kinetic models feature an opinion density depending on an additional microscopic variable, identified with the personal preference. This variable describes an opinion-driven polarisation process, leading finally to a choice among some possible options, as it happens e.g. in referendums or elections. Like in the kinetic theory of rarefied gases, the derivation of hydrodynamic equations is essentially based on the computation of the local equilibrium distribution of the opinions from the underlying kinetic model. Several numerical examples validate the resulting model, shedding light on the crucial role played by the distinction between opinion and preference formation on the choice processes in multi-agent societies. {$<$}/p{$>$}},

Although there are centrality indexes defined for weighted graphs, the discussions on this subject are far from over, especially because the influence of edge weights in this regard can vary not only in form but also in intensity, a still incipient approach so far.

The World Values Survey and European Values Study data from 101 countries were used. The K-means method of cluster analysis and the Variance Ration Criterion for determining the final number of clusters were performed. The solution with three clusters appeared as the most appropriate and theoretically meaningful, representing three broad cultural value syndromes. The first value syndrome was defined by low self-expression and high secular-rational values (the zone of secularized authority), the second one by low secular-rational and low self-expression values (the zone of traditional authority), while the third was characterized by high values on both value dimensions (the zone of emancipation). The countries' cluster membership is highly correlated with the (non-)communist past and the level of socioeconomic development. The countries in three cultural zones significantly differ in terms of the state of democracy: democracy is more fully developed in the countries in the cultural zone of emancipation, and the least developed in the countries with the prevailing traditional authority cultural outlook.},

In this paper, we discuss and demonstrate the benefits of using a reference model in variable selection.

As a result, using the reference model predictions in the model selection procedure reduces the variability and improves stability leading to improved model selection performance. Assuming that a Bayesian reference model describes the true distribution of future data well, the theoretically preferred usage of the reference model is to project its predictive distribution to a reduced model leading to projection predictive variable selection approach. Alternatively, reference models may also be used in an ad-hoc manner in combination with common variable selection methods. In several numerical experiments, we investigate the performance of the projective prediction approach as well as alternative variable selection methods with and without reference models. Our results indicate that the use of reference models generally translates into better and more stable variable selection. Additionally, we demonstrate that the projection predictive approach shows superior performance as compared to alternative variable selection methods independently of whether or not they use reference models.},

The traditional version of this agent-based model is to assign a cultural vector of \$F\$ components to each agent, where each component can take one of \$Q\$ cultural trait. In this work, we introduce a novel set of mean field master equations to describe the model for \$F=2\$ and \$F=3\$ in complete graphs where all indirect interactions are explicitly calculated. We find that the transition between different macroscopic states is driven by initial conditions (set by parameter \$Q\$) and the size of the system \$N\$, who measures the balance between linear and cubic terms in master equations. We also find that this analytical approach fully agrees with simulations where the system does not break up during the dynamics and a scaling relation related to missing links reestablishes the agreement when this happens.},

The detectability of a single planted partition has previously been analysed in detail and a phase transition has been identified below which the partition cannot be detected. Here we show that, in the hierarchical setting, there exist additional phases in which the presence of multiple consistent partitions can either help or hinder detection. Accordingly, the detectability limit for non-hierarchical partitions typically provides insufficient information about the detectability of the complete hierarchical structure, as we highlight with several constructive examples.},

  abstract = {Community detection is one of the most important and challenging problems in graph mining and social network analysis. Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) based methods have been proved to be effective in the task of community detection. However, real-world networks could be noisy and existing NMF based community detection methods are sensitive to the outliers and noise due to the utilization of the squared loss function to measure the quality of graph regularization and network reconstruction. In this paper, we propose a framework based on the nonnegative residual matrix factorization (NRMF) to overcome this limitation. In this method, a residual matrix, represented by the matrix reconstruction error, is explicitly introduced to capture the impact of outliers and noise. The residual matrix should be sparse intuitively so some sparse regularization can be used to model the sparsity. Specifically, three different types of sparse regularization, i.e., L0L0L\_0, L1L1L\_\{1\} and L2,1L2,1L\_\{2,1\}, have been studied. Multiplicative update rules and different thresholding operators are used to learn these lower-rank matrices. Extensive experiments on benchmark networks with and without known communities demonstrate that our framework is more robust so that it outperforms state-of-the-art NMF based approaches in community detection task.},

In education, school and teacher effects on students are often measured through value-added models (VAMs) that are not fully understood. We propose a framework that relates to the education production function in its most flexible form and connects with the basic VAMs without using untenable assumptions. We illustrate how, due to measurement error (ME), cross-group imbalances created by nonrandom group assignment cause correlations that drive the models' treatment-effect estimate bias. We derive formulas to calculate bias and rank the models and show that no model is better in all situations. The framework and formulas' workings are verified and illustrated via simulation. We also evaluate the performance of latent variable/errors-in-variables models that handle ME and study the role of extra covariates including lags of the outcome.},

  abstract = {Complex systems often exhibit multiple levels of organization covering a wide range of physical scales, so the study of the hierarchical decomposition of their structure and function is frequently convenient. To better understand this phenomenon, we introduce a generalization of information theory that works with hierarchical partitions. We begin revisiting the recently introduced hierarchical mutual information (HMI), and show that it can be written as a level by level summation of classical conditional mutual information terms. Then, we prove that the HMI is bounded from above by the corresponding hierarchical joint entropy. In this way, in analogy to the classical case, we derive hierarchical generalizations of many other classical information-theoretic quantities. In particular, we prove that, as opposed to its classical counterpart, the hierarchical generalization of the variation of information is not a metric distance, but it admits a transformation into one. Moreover, focusing on potential applications of the existing developments of the theory, we show how to adjust by chance the HMI. We also corroborate and analyze all the presented theoretical results with exhaustive numerical computations, and include an illustrative application example of the introduced formalism. Finally, we mention some open problems that should be eventually addressed for the proposed generalization of information theory to reach maturity.},

  abstract = {Many social interactions are characterised by dynamic interplay, such that individuals exert reciprocal influence over each other's behaviours and beliefs. The present study investigated how the dynamics of reciprocal influence affect individual beliefs in a social context, over and above the information communicated in an interaction. To this end, we developed a simple social decisionmaking paradigm in which two people are asked to make perceptual judgments while receiving information about each other's decisions. In a Static condition, information about the partner only conveyed their initial, independent judgment. However, in a Dynamic condition, each individual saw the evolving belief of their partner as they learnt about and responded to the individual's own judgment. The results indicated that in both conditions, the majority of confidence adjustments were characterised by an abrupt change followed by smaller adjustments around an equilibrium, and that participants' confidence was used to arbitrate conflict (although deviating from Bayesian norm). Crucially, recursive interaction had systematic effects on belief change relative to the Static baseline, magnifying confidence change when partners agreed and reducing confidence change when they disagreed. These findings indicate that during dynamic interactions\textemdash often a characteristic of real-life and online social contexts\textemdash information is collectively transformed rather than acted upon by individuals in isolation. Consequently, the output of social events is not only influenced by what the dyad knows but also by predictable recursive and self-reinforcing dynamics.},

  abstract = {Systematic failures in attempts to modernize Serbian society during the past two centuries have led to the survival of traditionalist value orientations. The long period of Ottoman rule allowed patriarchal, warrior-tribal cultural patterns to persist and shape the basis for national and overall cultural identity. Extreme poverty, autarkical agricultural production, the slow penetration of capitalism and a market economy, an undifferentiated social structure with majority of rural population, patriarchal organization of both the private and public sphere and the authoritarian character of authority, were characteristics of Serbian pre-modern society, which inhibited its development and contributed to the persistence of traditionalism. Although the socialist period was modernizing in many respects, homology between socialist and pre-modern collectivist, egalitarian and authoritarian orientation, made it easy for nationalism to penetrate and consequently led to decomposition of the state in civil wars. Delayed post-socialist transformation, characterized by civil war, economic collapse, extreme impoverishment, and international isolation, has only strengthened the orientation towards pre-modern patterns of identification. This paper examines the persistence of collectivism, authoritarianism and patriarchal orientation in the period of unhindered post-socialist transformation, based on the data obtained in the "South-East European Social Survey Project" (SEESSP), conducted from December 2003 to January 2004. These results are compared with those obtained in the research project "Changes in the Class Structure and Mobility in Serbia", conducted in 1989.},

We employ a simple decision theoretic framework with partial incumbent policy persistence and spatial voting to examine the three channels jointly. We show that a reform designed to encourage ideological moderation produces larger effects on polarization when the reform is implemented than when it is removed. The key insight is that implementing a moderation-inducing reform generates a set of challengers who are more likely to defeat incumbents while the incumbents are more likely to win reelection when the reform is removed. We then empirically examine how elections and legislative polarization respond to unlimited PAC contributions in state legislatures. Examining incumbents' decisions to stand for reelection, the electoral performance of incumbents who do run, and partisan polarization, we find empirical support for our predictions.},

We also present a link prediction framework called ECNE-LP, which given a target link (\dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend, \dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend ) first collects paths between nodes \dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend{} and \dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend, then directly embeds the edges in these paths, and finally aggregates them toward predicting the existence of a link. We show that both ECNE and ECNE-LP bring benefit wrt the state-of-the-art.},

  abstract = {In this article we presented a brief study of the main network models with growth and preferential attachment. Such models are interesting because they present several characteristics of real systems. We started with the classical model proposed by Barabasi and Albert: nodes are added to the network connecting preferably to other nodes that are more connected. We also presented models that consider more representative elements from social perspectives, such as the homophily between the vertices or the fitness that each node has to build connections. Furthermore, we showed a version of these models including the Euclidean distance between the nodes as a preferential attachment rule. Our objective is to investigate the basic properties of these networks as distribution of connectivity, degree correlation, shortest path, cluster coefficient and how these characteristics are affected by the preferential attachment rules. Finally, we also provided a comparison of these synthetic networks with real ones. We found that characteristics as homophily, fitness and geographic distance are significant preferential attachment rules to modeling real networks. These rules can change the degree distribution form of these synthetic network models and make them more suitable to model real networks.},

Despite the often-found sizable correlations between these two cultural value divides, the present paper theorizes that this relationship is not a cross-contextual constant, but rather a specific feature of secularized contexts where moral traditionalism is relatively marginal. We test this theory by means of a two-stage statistical analysis of the data from the four waves of the European Values Study (1981\textendash 2008) for 17 Western European countries. Our findings confirm that the two value divides are most strongly connected in the most secularized contexts because the latter are least morally traditionalist. While the two cultural divides hence tend to be distinct in more religious Western-European countries, they tend to coalesce into one single ``new'' cultural divide in more secular ones.},

(1) I offer a developmental theory of turnout. This framework follows from the observation that most citizens are habitual voters or habitual nonvoters (they display inertia). Most young citizens start their political lives as habitual nonvoters but they vary in how long it takes to develop into habitual voters. With this transition at the core of the framework, previous findings concerning costs and resources can easily be integrated into developmental theory. (2) I make a methodological contribution by applying latent growth curve models to panel data. (3) Finally, the empirical analyses provide the developmental theory with strong support and also provide a better understanding of the roles of aging, parenthood, partisanship, and geographic mobility.},

In this article, we investigate the extent to which these mixed results are due to the contingent nature of inequality on turnout, which depends upon the nature of the policy options that are presented to the electorate. We test these expectations on data from national elections in 30 established democracies from 1965 through 2017 covering 300 elections. Regression analysis using country-level fixed effects reveals consistent evidence in favor of our hypotheses: Inequality tends to have a negative impact on turnout, especially in depolarized party systems, but as party system polarization increases the negative impact of inequality is mitigated.},

  abstract = {Social psychological research has analyzed immigration attitudes mostly from the perspective of natives without an immigrant background. Nevertheless, an increasing number of migrants obtain national citizenship and take a stance towards immigration policies. By studying immigration policy attitudes reported by naturalized citizens, this article develops a dual-pathway model of immigrant political incorporation featuring pathways of either absorption or transformation. Based on a unique sample of immigrants who just accomplished the naturalization procedure (N = 566), we investigate participants' preferences for permissive or restrictive immigration policies as a function of their naturalization motives and expectations about how immigrants should acculturate in the receiving society (i.e., acculturation orientations). Our findings provide evidence for both processes of political absorption and transformation. On the one hand, belongingness motives underlying naturalization were connected to orientations towards host culture adoption, which in turn predicted support for restrictive immigration policies. On the other hand, instrumental motives were connected to orientations towards heritage culture maintenance, which in turn predicted support for permissive immigration policies. To conclude, we discuss the social psychological dynamics involved in the transition from national outsiders to national insiders and highlight the effects of naturalization on power relations between national majority and immigrant minority groups.},

The pH and PCO2 of the control perfusate were 7.40 and 39 mmHg, respectively. In the rabbit septum a metabolic acidosis (pH equals 6.82, PCO2 equals 39 mmHg) caused a loss of 16\% of control tension in 12 min. Na+ and K+ exchange were unaltered. A comparable respiratory acidosis (pH equals 6.81, PCO2 equals 159 mmHg) caused a 51\% loss of tension in 2 min. Na+ exchange was unaltered but K+ efflux fell from 8.9 +/- 0.6 (mean +/- SE) to 4.9 +/- 0.3 mmol/kg dry wt per min (P less than 0.001, n equals 10). A net gain of K+ of 16.9 +/- 1.7 (n equals 14) mmol/kg dry wt occurred and was attributable to a delayed fall in K+ influx relative to efflux over 15 min. The net gain could not be mimicked by epinephrine administration or blocked by propranolol and was absent in the beating rat septum and the quiescent rabbit septum. These results suggest that the net uptake of K+, which appears to be dependent on a period of depolarization, and the changes of contractility are controlled by the H+ ion concentration at a cellular site whose exchange with the extracellular space is characterized by a considerable restriction of diffusion. Changes of contractility are not related to the net uptake of K+.},

In a recent project I faced several such challenges and eventually realized that the relevant issues were familiar to users of free and open-source software. I needed a team with diverse skills and knowledge to tackle methods, theories, and topics. We needed to iterate over the entire project: from the initial theories to the data to the methods to the results. We had to understand how to work when some data was freely available but other data that might benefit the research was not. More broadly, computational social scientists may need creative solutions to slippery problems, such as restrictions imposed by terms of service for sites from which we wish to gather data. Are these terms legal, are they enforced, or do our institutional review boards care? Lastly\textemdash perhaps most importantly and dauntingly\textemdash we may need to challenge laws relating to digital data and access, although so far this conflict has been rare.

The proposed approach is aimed at automatic extraction of the relevant information by disentangling the actual influences from noise, via a two step procedure. First, a sparse principal component projection is performed on the standardized voting data. Then, the projected data is combined with a generative mixture model, and an information theoretic measure, which we refer to as Political Data-aNalytic Affinity (Political DNA), is finally derived. We show that the definition of this new affinity measure, together with suitable visualization tools for displaying the results of analysis, allows a better understanding and interpretability of the relationships among political groups.},

After providing an overview of both types of volatility in post-communist countries, the causes of volatility are analysed using a larger dataset than those used in previous studies. The results are startling: most findings based on elections in post-communist countries included in previous studies disappear. Instead, entry and exit volatility is found to be largely a function of long-term economic recovery, and it becomes clear that very little is known about what causes `party switching' volatility. As a robustness test of this latter result, the authors demonstrate that systematic explanations for party-switching volatility in Western Europe can indeed be found. [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]},

  abstract = {Community detection is one of the most important and challenging problems in network analysis. However, real-world networks may have very different structural properties and communities of various nature. As a result, it is hard (or even impossible) to develop one algorithm suitable for all datasets. A standard machine learning tool is to consider a parametric algorithm and choose its parameters based on the dataset at hand. However, this approach is not applicable to community detection since usually no labeled data is available for such parameter tuning. In this paper, we propose a simple and effective procedure allowing to tune hyperparameters of any given community detection algorithm without requiring any labeled data. The core idea is to generate a synthetic network with properties similar to a given real-world one, but with known communities. It turns out that tuning parameters on such synthetic graph also improves the quality for a given real-world network. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, we show significant improvements obtained for several well-known parametric community detection algorithms on a variety of synthetic and real-world datasets.},

Second, our panel and experimental data allow for             the most definitive test to date of whether political orientations exert a causal             effect on religious and secular orientations. Third, we isolate the conditions under             which politics affects religious\textendash secular perspectives, thus identifying the mechanism             that underlies political orientations.          {$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Community is a common characteristic of networks including social networks, biological networks, computer and information networks, to name a few. Community detection is a basic step for exploring and analysing these network data. Typically, homogenous network is a type of networks which consists of only one type of objects with one type of links connecting them. There has been a large body of developments in models and algorithms to detect communities over it. However, real-world networks naturally exhibit heterogeneous qualities appearing as multiple types of objects with multi-relational links connecting them. Those heterogeneous information could facilitate the community detection for its constituent homogeneous networks, but has not been fully explored. In this paper, we exploit heterogeneous multi-relational networks (HMRNet) and propose an efficient message passing based algorithm to simultaneously detect communities for all homogeneous networks. Specifically, an HMRNet is reorganized into a hierarchical structure with homogeneous networks as its layers and heterogeneous links connecting them. To detect communities in such an HMRNet, the problem is formulated as a maximum a posterior (MAP) over a factor graph. Finally a message passing based algorithm is derived to find a best solution of the MAP problem. Evaluation on both synthetic and real-world networks confirms the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

In particular we focus on how different size (in the number of media) and interaction patterns of the information system may affect collective debates and thus the opinions' distribution. We introduce a sophisticated computational model of opinion dynamics which accounts for the coexistence of media and gossip as separated mechanisms and for their feedback loops. The model accounts also for the effect of the media communication patterns by considering both the simple case where each medium mimics the behavior of the most successful one (to maximize the audience) and the case where there is polarization and thus competition among media memes. We show that plurality and competition within information sources lead to stable configurations where several and distant cultures coexist.},

Previous researches focused on the irreversible propagation process, such as the independent cascade model and the threshold model, which can be categorized into the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model type. The other type is the reversible propagation process with steady state such as the Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) model, where the question of identifying important nodes has not received enough attention. In this paper, we study the problem of identifying vital nodes in the SIS spreading process in complex networks. We articulate a single-node control model to evaluate the influence of nodes in the reversible spreading system. By considering network structural and reversible spreading characteristics, we propose a new measure to quantify the node influence based on its neighbors' centrality and infection risk. By applying the commonly used centralities such as degree and coreness, this new measure can identify the most influential spreaders more accurately than the benchmark centralities. The proposed single-node control model and ranking method open up a new idea in identifying influential spreaders and validate the necessity of introducing the dynamical state in the reversible systems.},

In this paper we present the largest comparative study yet conducted on turnout misreporting. By utilising 20 years of data from Comparative Study of Electoral Systems (CSES) we analyse 184 elections across 55 different states. In addition to testing the social desirability and mode effects explanations for misreporting, we examine the electoral and party systems and survey methodology. The results show that the operation of the electoral system and the survey methodology are the most important explanations for misreporting, but there are also significant effects for the election context and the party system. These results provide an important corrective to current studies by showing that institutional factors are at least as important in shaping misreporting as methodology.},

In this paper, we propose a scalable and statistically efficient approach for graphical model structure discovery for multivariate data involving continuous variables. Our approach uses a minimum message length (MML)-based objective, for which we design a greedy algorithm where the best edges maximising improvements to the MML-based score are added incrementally to the graphical model. We present extensive empirical results on synthetic data with different sample, variable, clique and inverse correlation coefficient and show that our method outperforms strong baselines in terms of both speed and the accuracy of the predicted associations among the random variables in the graphical model. We also report that our method performs significantly very well in AML, BRCA cancer data and other real-life datasets.},

By adopting flexibility in exploring a node's neighbourhood, overlapping communities are captured. Two kinds of node neighbourhoods based on hop distance and functionality is defined and incorporated both local and global graph representation. Our algorithm is validated by applying it to large social network datasets and visualizing the number of clusters obtained. The clusters depict the various parameters on which the communities have been separated into. The larger the number of clusters, the larger is the complexity of the communities that the dataset has been separated into.

  abstract = {Linear threshold models have been studied extensively in structured populations; however, less attention is paid to perception differences among the individuals of the population. To focus on this effect, we exclude structure and consider a well-mixed population of heterogeneous agents, each associated with a threshold in the form of a fixed ratio within zero and one that can be unique to this agent. The agents are initialized with a choice of strategy A or B, and at each time step, one agent becomes active to update; if the ratio of agents playing A is higher (resp. lower) than her threshold, she updates to A (resp. B). We show that for any given initial condition, after a finite number of time steps, the population reaches an equilibrium where no agent's threshold is violated; however, the equilibrium is not necessarily uniquely determined by the initial condition but depends on the agents' activation sequence. We find all those possible equilibria that the dynamics may reach from a given initial condition and show that, in contrast to the case of homogeneous populations, heterogeneity in the agents' thresholds gives rise to several equilibria where both A-playing and B-playing agents coexist. Perception heterogeneity can, hence, preserve decision diversity, even in the absence of population structure. We also investigate the asymptotic stability of the equilibria and show how to calculate the contagion probability for a population with two thresholds.},

Therefore, the problem of missing data is a crucial and unavoidable issue in analysis and modeling of real-world social networks.

The present paper tries to infer the unobserved data from both diffusion network and network structure by learning a model from the partially observed data. We develop a probabilistic generative model called "DiffStru" to jointly discover the hidden links of network structure and the omitted diffusion activities. The interrelations among links of nodes and cascade processes are utilized in the proposed method via learning coupled low dimensional latent factors. In addition to inferring the unseen data, the learned latent factors may also help network classification problems such as community detection. Simulation results on synthetic and real-world datasets show the excellent performance of the proposed method in terms of link prediction and discovering the identity and infection time of invisible social behaviors.},

Although its political institutions proved both resilient and adaptable, allowing it to incorporate diverse populations, the Empire suffered from many internal conflicts. Indeed, most emperors died violently, from assassination, suicide, or in battle. These internal conflicts produced patterns in the length of time that can be identified by statistical analysis. In this paper, we study the underlying patterns associated with the reign of the Roman emperors by using statistical tools of survival data analysis. We consider all the 175 Roman emperors and propose a new power-law model with change points to predict the time-to-violent-death of the Roman emperors. This model encompasses data in the presence of censoring and long-term survivors, providing more accurate predictions than previous models. Our results show that power-law distributions can also occur in survival data, as verified in other data types from natural and artificial systems, reinforcing the ubiquity of power law distributions. The generality of our approach paves the way to further related investigations not only in other ancient civilizations but also in applications in engineering and medicine.},

Whereby the bulk of literature on natural hazard management has its focus on the natural process, an increasing number of scholars is emphasizing the importance of human activity in this context. Existing literature has identified certain socio-economic factors that determine the impact of natural disasters on society. The purpose of this paper is to highlight the effects of the institutional framework that influences human behavior by setting incentives and to point out the importance of institutional vulnerability. Results from an empirical investigation of large scale natural disasters between 1984 and 2004 show that countries with better institutions experience less victims and lower economic losses from natural disasters. In addition, the results suggest a non-linear relationship between economic development and economic disaster losses. The suggestions in this paper have implications for the discussion on how to deal with the adverse effects of natural hazards and how to develop efficient adaption strategies.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Research on individual variation has received increased attention. The bulk of the models discussed in psychological research so far, focus mainly on the temporal development of the mean structure. We expand the view on the within-person residual variability and present a new model parameterization derived from classic multivariate GARCH models used to predict and forecast volatility in financial time-series. We propose a new pdBEKK and a modified DCC model that accommodate external time-varying predictors for the within-person variance. This main goal of this work is to evaluate the potential usefulness of MGARCH models for research in within-person variability. MGARCH models partition the within-person variance into, at least, three components: An overall constant and unconditional baseline variance, a process that introduces variance conditional on previous innovations, or random shocks, and a process that governs the carry-over effects of previous conditional variance, similar to an AR model. Moreover, these models allow for variance spill-over effects from one time-series to another. We illustrate the pdBEKK- and the DCC-MGARCH on two individuals who have rated their daily positive and negative affect over 100 consecutive days. The full models comprised a multivariate ARMA(1,1) model for the means and included physical activity as moderator of the overall baseline variance. Overall, the pdBEKK seems to result in a more straight forward psychological interpretation, but the DCC is generally easier to estimate and can accommodate more simultaneous time-series. Both models require rather large amounts of datapoints to detect non-zero parameters. Potentials and limitations are discussed. We provide an R-package bmgarch that facilitates the estimation of these types of models.},

Given a lack of longitudinal studies in real-world settings, it remains unclear if individuals have coherent attitude systems at all\textemdash and, if they do, what produces attitude constraint. I argue and show that groups can endogenously produce attitude constraint via cognitive authorities. Within groups, cognitive authorities explicitly link attitudes and generate feelings of connectedness among members, thereby facilitating the interpersonal processing of attitudes. Using data on interpersonal sentiment relations and attitude changes among members of intentional communities, I find cognitive authorities constrain attitudes via two mechanisms: (1) interpersonal tensions when attitudes and sentiment relations are misaligned (i.e., balance dynamics), and (2) social influence processes leading to attitude changes that are concordant with the group's attitude system (i.e., constraint satisfaction). These findings imply that attitude change models based exclusively on interpersonal contagion or individual drives for cognitive consistency overlook important ways group structures affect how individuals feel and think.},

  abstract = {Although the notion of trust is widely used in secure information systems, very few works attempt to formally define it or reason about it. Moreover, in most works, trust is defined as a binary concept\textemdash either an entity is completely trusted or not at all. Absolute trust on an entity requires one to have complete knowledge about the entity. This is rarely the case in real-world applications. Not trusting an entity, on the other hand, prohibits all communications with the entity rendering it useless. In short, treating trust as a binary concept is not acceptable in practice. Consequently, a model is needed that incorporates the notion of different degrees of trust. We propose a model that allows us to formalize trust relationships. The trust relationship between a truster and a trustee is associated with a context and depends on the experience, knowledge, and recommendation that the truster has with respect to the trustee in the given context. We show how our model can measure trust and compare two trust relationships in a given context. Sometimes enough information is not available about a given context to evaluate trust. Towards this end we show how the relationships between different contexts can be captured using a context graph. Formalizing the relationships between contexts allows us to extrapolate values from related contexts to approximate the trust of an entity even when all the information needed to calculate the trust is not available. Finally, we show how the semantic mismatch that arises because of different sources using different context graphs can be resolved and the trust of information obtained from these different sources compared.},

  abstract = {Intervals between discrete events representing human activities, as well as other types of events, often obey heavy-tailed distributions, and their impacts on collective dynamics on networks such as contagion processes have been intensively studied. The literature supports that such heavy-tailed distributions are present for inter-event times associated with both individual nodes and individual edges in networks. However, the simultaneous presence of heavy-tailed distributions of inter-event times for nodes and edges is a non-trivial phenomenon, and its origin has been elusive. In the present study, we propose a generative model and its variants to explain this phenomenon. We assume that each node independently transits between a high-activity and low-activity state according to a continuous-time two-state Markov process and that, for the main model, events on an edge occur at a high rate if and only if both end nodes of the edge are in the high-activity state. In other words, two nodes interact frequently only when both nodes prefer to interact with others. The model produces distributions of inter-event times for both individual nodes and edges that resemble heavy-tailed distributions across some scales. It also produces positive correlation in consecutive inter-event times, which is another stylized observation for empirical data of human activity. We expect that our modeling framework provides a useful benchmark for investigating dynamics on temporal networks driven by non-Poissonian event sequences.},

It is shown that this method is different from those classical algorithms relying on static fitness metrics that depict the inhomogeneous connectivity across the network. The proposed method is validated from two aspects. First, by estimating the eigenvectors of adjacency matrices, we investigate the detectability limit of our algorithms on random networks, which together with the results concerning the convergence speed of consensus guarantees the performance of our method theoretically. Second, experiments on both \textbackslash tcblarge scale real-world networks and artificial benchmarks show that our method is very effective and competitive on hierarchical modular graphs. In particular, it outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms on overlapping community detection.},

  abstract = {There is growing environmental psychology and behavior literature with mixed empirical evidence about the influence of public risk perceptions on the adoption of environmentally friendly ``green behaviors''. Adoption of stormwater green infrastructure on residential properties, while costlier in the short term compared to conventional greywater infrastructure, plays an important role in the reduction of nutrient loading from non-point sources into freshwater rivers and lakes. In this study, we use Bayesian Belief Networks (BBNs) to analyze a 2015 survey dataset (sample size = 472 respondents) about the adoption of green infrastructure (GSI) in Vermont's residential areas, most of which are located in either the Lake Champlain Basin or Connecticut River Basin. Eight categories of GSI were investigated: roof diversion, permeable pavement, infiltration trenches, green roofs, rain gardens, constructed wetlands, tree boxes, and others. Using both unsupervised and supervised machine learning algorithms, we used Bayesian Belief Networks to quantify the influence of public risk perceptions on GSI adoption while accounting for a range of demographic and spatial variables. We also compare the effectiveness of the Bayesian Belief Network approach and logistic regression in predicting the pro-environmental behaviors (adoption of GSI). The results show that influencing factors for current adoption differ by the type of GSI. Increased perception of risk from stormwater issues is associated with the adoption of rain gardens and infiltration trenches. Runoff issues are more likely to be considered the governments' (town, state, and federal agencies) responsibility, whereas lawn erosion is more likely to be considered the residents' responsibility. When using the same set of variables to predict pro-environmental behaviors (adoption of GSI), the BBN approach produces more accurate predictions compared to logistic regression. The results provide insights for further research on how to encourage residents to take measures for mitigating stormwater issues and stormwater management.},

Static models minimize bias but assume data are temporally independent, resulting in a loss of efficiency. Dynamic models explicitly model temporal data structures, but smooth estimates of the latent trait across time, resulting in bias when the latent trait changes rapidly. We address this tradeoff by investigating a new approach for modeling and evaluating latent variable estimates: a robust dynamic model. The robust model is capable of minimizing bias and accommodating volatile changes in the latent trait. Simulations demonstrate that the robust model outperforms other models when the underlying latent trait is subject to rapid change, and is equivalent to the dynamic model in the absence of volatility. We reproduce latent estimates from studies of judicial ideology and democracy. For judicial ideology, the robust model uncovers shocks in judicial voting patterns that were not previously identified in the dynamic model. For democracy, the robust model provides more precise estimates of sudden institutional changes such as the imposition of martial law in the Philippines (1972\textendash 1981) and the short-lived Saur Revolution in Afghanistan (1978). Overall, the robust model is a useful alternative to the standard dynamic model for modeling latent traits that change rapidly over time.},

We assign to each user a dynamical topic vector which measures the evolution of her/his opinion in this space and allows us to monitor the similarities and differences among groups of supporters of different candidates. Our results show that the method is able to detect the dynamics of formation of opinion on different topics and, in particular, it can capture the reshaping of the political opinion landscape which has led to the inversion of result between the two rounds of the 2015 election.},

In this paper, we explore what happens when a set of items that are not generated from a common factor construct model are nonetheless modeled as reflecting a common factor. Through a series of hypothetical examples and an empirical re-analysis, we show that (1) common factor models tend to produce extremely biased and highly variable structural parameter estimates when the population model is not a common factor model; (2) model fit is a poor indicator of the degree of bias; and (3) composite models are sometimes more reliable than common factor models under alternative measurement structures, though they also lead to unacceptably bad solutions in some cases.}

  abstract = {Most natural language processing research focuses on modelling and understanding text formed of complete sentences with correct spelling and grammar. However, livestream chat is drastically different. Viewers are typically writing short messages while responding to in-stream events, often with incorrect grammar and many repeated tokens. Additionally, tokens that are commonly used in livestream chat are unknown to traditional language understanding efforts that focus on prosaic text. To advance and encourage further research in terms of livestream chat understanding, in this work, we present a large-scale dataset of video game livestream chat, consisting of over 60 million tokens. As livestreaming becomes more popular it is also increasingly pertinent to study, though chat analysis, the way in which the audience is engaging with the stream. However, this is not a straightforward task, livestream chat is a rich and complex domain, far removed from often studied prosaic text. Additionally. we provide a case study analysis of word vector methods applied to the dataset, showing that the vector space is strangely shaped but clusterable and that the resulting clusters correlate with features such as streamer popularity. Furthermore, human relatedness tests highlight the difference that this domain poses with respect to prosaic text. It is hoped the livestream chat dataset, the discussion of its unique features, and the challenges highlighted for future work will invigorate the research community into further study of livestream chat.},

It is also argued that the general public has a perception of this concept similar to that of the elites. This article analyses the left-right continuum at the elite and mass levels in five countries, before and after the recent severe financial crisis. It investigates: i) the relative weight of values vs partisanship as the basis of left-right self-placement; ii) whether political elites and citizens share the same factors underpinning ideology; and iii) whether there have been any changes in these factors as a consequence of the 2007-2008 financial crisis. The study is a quantitative analysis making use of survey data. Findings indicate that both elites and masses concentrated in moderate positions both before and after the crisis; citizens do not follow elites when explaining left-right self-placement; and the financial crisis has led elites to move toward the right and the public toward the left. Before the crisis citizens used to base their position on the scale on partisanship more than on values. After the crisis, values surpassed partisanship.

Across three separate studies, I assess the test-retest reliability, measurement invariance, predictive validity, and replicability of SFT and IST, with the misanthropy scale (MST) and generalized social trust scale (GST) serving as benchmarks. First, tests of internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and longitudinal measurement invariance established that all four generalized trust scales were acceptably reliable, with SFT and IST yielding greater overall reliability than MST and GST. Second, tests of multiple group measurement invariance revealed that SFT and IST were invariant across gender, race, education, and age-groups, while MST and GST were nonequivalent across the same sociodemographic groups. Third, an investment game established the predictive validity of SFT and\textemdash to a lesser extent\textemdash MST, with IST and GST yielding poor predictive validity. Fourth, tests of factor structure and measurement invariance indicated that all four generalized trust scales replicated across samples. The present findings bolster the validity, reliability, and measurement invariance of SFT and IST, while illustrating the compromised validity and measurement invariance of MST and GST. Implications for the measurement of generalized trust are discussed.},

Both were designed to be objective, empirically valid, and easy to administer and score. To assess measurement validity and reliability, SFT and IST along with other common measures of social trust, sociodemographic characteristics, biographical characteristics, and a survey experiment were administered to a large representative sample of Qualtrics web-panel members (N = 2,041). Confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation models established the internal consistency, convergent validity, discriminant validity, and criterion validity of SFT and IST. Further tests revealed that SFT and IST correlate with well-established predictors of generalized trust, while other correlates like the age\textendash trust relation were called into question. Taken together, this article shows that SFT and IST are valid and reliable instruments for the measurement of generalized trust and that common measures of generalized trust appear to be less valid and less reliable.

In this article, we provide an overview and critical analysis of 363 articles produced in the first decade of this research program, with a focus on key theoretical, methodological, and empirical contributions. In addition, we turn our attention to the next decade of the network approach and propose critical avenues for future research in each of these domains. We argue that this program of research will be best served by working toward two overarching aims: (a) the identification of robust empirical phenomena and (b) the development of formal theories that can explain those phenomena. We recommend specific steps forward within this broad framework and argue that these steps are necessary if the network approach is to develop into a progressive program of research capable of producing a cumulative body of knowledge about how specific mental disorders operate as causal systems.},

Unfortunately, it is well known that for most systems with two or more state variables such potentials do not exist. Here we use an analogy with art to provide an accessible explanation of why this happens and briefly review some of the possible alternatives. Additionally, we introduce a novel and simple computational tool that implements one of those solutions: the decomposition of the differential equations into a gradient term, that has an associated potential, and a non-gradient term, that lacks it. In regions of the state space where the magnitude of the non-gradient term is small compared to the gradient part, we use the gradient term to approximate the potential as quasi-potential. The non-gradient to gradient ratio can be used to estimate the local error introduced by our approximation. Both the algorithm and a ready-to-use implementation in the form of an R package are provided.},

Initially, network analysis was motivated in part by the thought that it can be used for hypothesis generation. Although the customary approach for network modeling is inherently exploratory, we argue that there is untapped potential for confirmatory hypothesis testing. In this work, we bring to fruition the potential of Gaussian graphical models for generating testable hypotheses. This is accomplished by merging exploratory and confirmatory analyses into a cohesive framework built around Bayesian hypothesis testing of partial correlations. We first present a motivating example based on a customary, exploratory analysis, where it is made clear how information encoded by the conditional (in)dependence structure can be used to formulate hypotheses. Building upon this foundation, we then provide several empirical examples that unify exploratory and confirmatory testing in psychopathology symptom networks. In particular, we (1) estimate exploratory graphs; (2) derive hypotheses based on the most central structures; and (3) test those hypotheses in a confirmatory setting. Our confirmatory results uncovered an intricate web of relations, including an order to edge weights within comorbidity networks. This illuminates the rich and informative inferences that can be drawn with the proposed approach. We conclude with recommendations for applied researchers, in addition to discussing how our methodology answers recent calls to begin developing formal models related to the conditional (in)dependence structure of psychological networks.},

  abstract = {This study sought to describe the system of beliefs on gender, attitudes toward women, and wife beating, in young adults who live in Mysore, India. Furthermore, it identified structural sex differences in the interplay of values among these matters that can affect individual and community views toward domestic violence. Drawing from survey data gathered from 265 young adult Indian men and women, this study used network analysis to graph a correlation network of beliefs and attitudes toward domestic violence. Node, scale, and network structure descriptions allowed for comparisons among male and female participant responses. The findings support the assertion that there are sex differences among the system of beliefs toward wife beating among Indian young adults. Gender ideology, masculine role in relationships, and legal and social consequences of wife beating emerged as the most important values to focus on when addressing young men's beliefs of domestic violence and attitudes toward women. In contrast, values influencing women's perceptions of domestic violence are more complex and related to multiple beliefs about women's power, family structure, and social and legal implications of domestic violence. The results highlight the importance of recognizing gender differences in the connectivity between gender and wife beating beliefs when designing interventions. There is a need for efforts to accurately target these values and attitudes to more effectively address gendered attitudes and beliefs about domestic violence in this population.},

  abstract = {The ability to share social network data at the level of individual connections is beneficial to science: not only for reproducing results, but also for researchers who may wish to use it for purposes not foreseen by the data releaser. Sharing such data, however, can lead to serious privacy issues, because individuals could be re-identified, not only based on possible nodes' attributes, but also from the structure of the network around them. The risk associated with re-identification can be measured and it is more serious in some networks than in others. Various optimization algorithms have been proposed to anonymize the network while keeping the number of changes minimal. However, existing algorithms do not provide guarantees on where the changes will be made, making it difficult to quantify their effect on various measures. Using network models and real data, we show that the average degree of networks is a crucial parameter for the severity of re-identification risk from nodes' neighborhoods. Dense networks are more at risk, and, apart from a small band of average degree values, either almost all nodes are re-identifiable or they are all safe. Our results allow researchers to assess the privacy risk based on a small number of network statistics which are available even before the data is collected. As a rule-of-thumb, the privacy risks are high if the average degree is above 10. Guided by these results we propose a simple method based on edge sampling to mitigate the re-identification risk of nodes. Our method can be implemented already at the data collection phase. Its effect on various network measures can be estimated and corrected using sampling theory. These properties are in contrast with previous methods arbitrarily biasing the data. In this sense, our work could help in sharing network data in a statistically tractable way.},

First, I capitalize on the epidemiological view that IMR \textendash{} the most commonly used indicator of health in social sciences \textendash{} is better suited to reflect public health micromanagement than overall social development. Second, I theorize that autocrats have incentives to invest in health up to a certain point, which could lead to a reduction in IMR. Third, I introduce an omitted variable \textendash{} good governance \textendash{} that trumps the importance of a political regime for IMR: (1) it directly affects public health micromanagement, and (2) many autocrats made inroads in achieving good governance. Finally, for the first time in such research, I use a disaggregated IMR approach to corroborate my hypotheses.},

Finally, we expected that students from hard disciplines, compared to their peers from soft disciplines, would perceive stronger differences between biology and psychology (combined perspective). Hypotheses were tested, using Bayes factors, in N = 938 university students from a multitude of disciplines. Results revealed that university students perceive biology as considerably more absolute and less multiplistic compared to psychology. However, the findings also suggest that there are no strong interindividual differences between students from hard and soft disciplines regarding the perception of biology. Finally, results revealed that students enrolled in harder disciplines perceive a slightly stronger difference between biology and psychology. In sum, intraindividual effects were considerably stronger, which elicits doubt that students from hard disciplines espouse a fundamentally different set of epistemic beliefs than their peers from soft disciplines.},

Further uncertainty comes from a lack of knowledge of the potential effects of removing interventions once the epidemic is declining. By combining an epidemiological model of COVID-19 for the United Kingdom with simple sub-models for these societal processes, this study aims to shed light on the conceivable trajectories that the pandemic might follow over the next 1.5 years. We show strong improvements in outcomes if governments review NPI more frequently whereas, in comparison, the stability of compliance has surprisingly small effects on cumulative mortality. Assuming that mortality does considerably increase once a country's hospital capacity is breached, we show that the inherent randomness of societal processes can lead to a wide range of possible outcomes, both in terms of disease dynamics and mortality, even when the principles according to which policy and population operate are identical.. Our model is easily modified to take other aspects of the socio-pandemic interaction into account.},

In addition, epistemic democracy demands that two additional demands should be fulfilled, namely that the decisions produced by a democratic process also are `fair' and `true'. The fairness demand is in this article connected to the principle of human rights while the `true' demand related to the propensity of representative democracy to produce outcomes that increases human well-being. Empirical research shows that representative democracy without a high quality of the institutions responsible for implementing public policies do not deliver increased human well-being. A special problem is that representative democracy has not turned out to be a safe cure against endemic corruption. The `quality of government' factor thus implies control of corruption and also the rule of law and competence in the public administration. It is argued that meritocracy in the recruitment and promotion to positions in the public administration can serve to increase both the level of `fairness' and the level of `truth' in democracies.},

After outlining how image schemas can be identified in interviews, I reconstruct how 50 religious Americans unconsciously ``imagine'' religion's role in their lives. Focusing on the implicit rather than respondents' explicit discourse, I identify five image schemas that structure Americans' religious understandings. Although respondents' understandings often appear incoherent and inconsistent at the level of explicit discourse, I show that they are coherent and consistent at the level of implicit image schemas. I then use factor analysis to identify patterns in these implicit understandings across social divisions. I conclude by discussing the promise of image schema analysis for improving studies of religion and other areas, as well as for theorizing how culture works.},

The replication crisis has also prompted researchers to think more carefully about the possibility of making Type I errors when rejecting null hypotheses. In this context, the present article considers the utility of two types of Type I error probability: the Neyman\textendash Pearson long run Type I error rate and the Fisherian sample-specific Type I error probability. It is argued that the Neyman\textendash Pearson Type I error rate is inapplicable in social science because it refers to a long run of exact replications, and social science deals with irreversible units (people, social groups, and social systems) that make exact replications impossible. Instead, the Fisherian sample-specific Type I error probability is recommended as a more meaningful way to conceptualize false positive results in social science because it can be applied to each sample-specific decision about rejecting the same substantive null hypothesis in a series of direct replications. It is concluded that the replication crisis may be partly (not wholly) due to researchers' unrealistic expectations about replicability based on their consideration of the Neyman\textendash Pearson Type I error rate across a long run of exact replications.},

More importantly, the MFA is not explicitly derived from a mathematical model. An analysis of the implied model shows that it makes an approximation which is far from the truth and another one which can not be motivated in general.

In this paper, we critically evaluate the use of PMRF-based methods to generate causal hypotheses about an underlying directed causal structure. We argue that hypothesis generation is critically dependent on the specification of a target causal structure: This is generally absent from applications of PMRFs, researchers instead taking a causally-agnostic approach. We show that the agnostic approach is fundamentally problematic, since the heuristics typically used for hypothesis generation do not hold for all types of causal structure. The specification of a target structure, however, allows a principled approach to hypothesis generation and yields novel insights.},

This is a claim deserving of close scrutiny and much skepticism. What would it take to solve the Hard problem? One could answer the question of how it is possible that something like subjectivity could emerge from objective brain functioning (i.e., moving from a third person to a first person ontology), but a truly satisfying account might still require solving all the ``easy'' and ``real'' problems of consciousness. In this way, IWMT does not claim to definitively solve the Hard problem, as explaining all the particular ways that things feel across all relevant aspects of experience is likely an impossible task. Nonetheless, IWMT does claim to have made major inroads into our understanding of consciousness, and here I will attempt to justify this position by discussing challenging problems and outstanding questions with respect to philosophy, (neuro)phenomenology, computational principles, practical applications, and implications for existing theories of mind and life.},

To overcome this computational deficit, we undertook a statistical assessment of 200 real-world and simulated networks to decipher associations between centrality measures and developed an algorithm termed Integrated Value of Influence (IVI), which integrates the most important and commonly used network centrality measures in an unbiased way. When compared against 12 other contemporary influential node identification methods on ten different networks, the IVI algorithm outperformed all other assessed methods.

  abstract = {This article develops a mathematical formalization of Electoral volatility as a result of the composition of the electorate after two consecutive electoral events of the same type. Using algebra of sets, eight subsets of voters were distinguished. Subsequently, a matrix was constructed that allowed us to compute the proportion in the electorate of each category of voters as a linear combination of its entries. At the same time, it is shown this matrix operates in the linear transformation of the electoral results vector at time t, in its equivalent for t + 1, which leads us to a matrix representation of the electoral volatility index. To conclude, some methodological alternatives to infer the unknown quantities inside the matrix are mentioned; as well as some problems related to the discontinuity of political agents are addressed by this strategy.},

As an example, we analyze the performance of first 100 days of the current Government in power. We aim to account for major factors shaping the positive or negative sentiments of people during the tenure of these 100 days. Many important factors such as the GDP growth, the new traffic policy, article 370, budget, steps towards employability generation and ease of doing business, etc. are taken into account. These factors become contributing factors in our model and based on conditional probabilities, we calculate the overall positive and negative sentiments.},

While there exist extensive normative recommendations for prior setting, little is known about how priors are chosen in practice. We conducted a survey (N = 50) and interviews (N = 9) where we used interactive visualizations to elicit prior distributions from researchers experienced with Bayesian statistics and asked them for rationales for those priors. We found that participants' experience and philosophy influence how much and what information they are willing to incorporate into their priors, manifesting as different levels of informativeness and skepticism. We also identified three broad strategies participants use to set their priors: centrality matching, interval matching, and visual probability mass allocation. We discovered that participants' understanding of the notion of ``weakly informative priors''\textemdash a commonly-recommended normative approach to prior setting\textemdash manifests very differently across participants. Our results have implications both for how to develop prior setting recommendations and how to design tools to elicit priors in Bayesian analysis.},

Here we study the conditions in which such echo chambers emerge by introducing a simple model of information sharing in online social networks with the two ingredients of influence and unfriending. Users can change both their opinions and social connections based on the information to which they are exposed through sharing. The model dynamics show that even with minimal amounts of influence and unfriending, the social network rapidly devolves into segregated, homogeneous communities. These predictions are consistent with empirical data from Twitter. Although our findings suggest that echo chambers are somewhat inevitable given the mechanisms at play in online social media, they also provide insights into possible mitigation strategies.},

Using a large national probability sample of adults (N~=~19,078), we assessed the effects of social demographics, Big-Five personality traits, liberal-conservative ideology, political identity centrality, and weekly news exposure on the relationship between in-party and out-party support. Results show political identity centrality is the strongest and most consistent moderator. The effects of some other moderators (e.g., personality, news exposure) are party-specific.},

The static model, an extension of the Fortuin\textendash Kasteleyn model, provides a parsimonious explanation of the positive manifold and intelligence's hierarchical factor structure. We show how it can explain the Matthew effect across developmental stages. Finally, we introduce a method for studying growth dynamics.

Such a trend may be understood as an outcome of a spontaneous dynamical process driven by the recent advancement of information communication technology that allows people to preferentially select their information sources. Here we study, using an agent-based model of adaptive social network dynamics, how extreme ideas may arise in society in which individuals simply try to conform to social norm within their social neighborhood. Our model assumes that each node gradually assimilates its state to local social norm, i.e., the average of its in-neighbors' states, while also changing edge weights based on their states. Numerical simulations revealed that, when individuals tend to practice homophily by strengthening their ties selectively to neighbors with similar states, there tends to be many extreme ideas emerging in society while the network topology tends to become fragmented. Such outcomes are mitigated, however, when individuals also practice novelty-seeking behavior by increasing attention to neighbors whose ideas do not conform to the local social norm. These results paint a paradoxical picture of complex social processes \textemdash{} society produces difference when individuals seek sameness, or society reaches sameness when individuals seek difference.},

Important theoretical advances in the detection of modular, or "community", structures have included identifying fundamental limits of detectability by formally defining community structure using probabilistic generative models. Detecting hierarchical community structure introduces additional challenges alongside those inherited from community detection. Here we present a theoretical study on hierarchical community structure in networks, which has thus far not received the same rigorous attention. We address the following questions: 1)\textasciitilde How should we define a valid hierarchy of communities? 2)\textasciitilde How should we determine if a hierarchical structure exists in a network? and 3)\textasciitilde how can we detect hierarchical structure efficiently? We approach these questions by introducing a definition of hierarchy based on the concept of stochastic externally equitable partitions and their relation to probabilistic models, such as the popular stochastic block model. We enumerate the challenges involved in detecting hierarchies and, by studying the spectral properties of hierarchical structure, present an efficient and principled method for detecting them.},

To do so we couple the dynamics of a heterogeneous bounded confidence Hegselmann-Krause model with that of the resources that the agents invest on each opinion change. The outcomes of the dynamics are non-trivial and strongly depend on the different regions of the confidence parameter space. In particular, a second order phase transition, for which we determine the corresponding critical exponents, is found in the region where a re-entrant consensus phase is observed in the heterogeneous Hegselmann-Krause model. For regions where consensus always exist in the heterogeneous Hegselmann-Krause model, the introduction of cost does not lead to a phase transition but just to a continuous decrease of the size of the largest opinion cluster. Finally in the region where fragmentation is expected in the heterogeneous HK model, the introduction of a very small cost paradoxically increases the size of the largest opinion cluster.},

The inherent benevolence assumption implemented in many multiagent systems can have hazardous consequences when dealing with deceit in open systems. The aim of this paper is to establish a mechanism that helps agents to cope with environments inhabited by both selfish and cooperative entities. This is achieved by enabling agents to evaluate trust in others. A formalization and an algorithm for trust are presented so that agents can autonomously deal with deception and identify trustworthy parties in open systems. The approach is twofold: agents can observe the behavior of others and thus collect information for establishing an initial trust model. In order to adapt quickly to a new or rapidly changing environment, one enables agents to also make use of observations from other agents. The practical relevance of these ideas is demonstrated by means of a direct mapping from a scenario to electronic commerce.},

A number of studies have shown that voter turnout is lower in unequal countries. In particular, citizens with fewer resources abstain at higher rates. Since populist parties seek to mobilize these groups, their success could lead to higher and less unequal turnout rates. To assess empirically whether this holds true, we analyzed a dataset encompassing data on 296 national parliamentary elections in 31 European countries between 1970 and 2016. The results show that there is neither a direct nor an indirect effect of populism on voter turnout. In elections with more successful populist parties, voter turnout was not significantly higher than in other elections. Higher vote shares of populist parties also do not mitigate the negative impact of income inequality on voter turnout. Finally, there does not seem to be a difference between elections with high left-wing or right-wing populist parties' success. Neither variant of populism alters the relationship between inequality and turnout.},

We formally test the postulated structure and several potential refinements. We employ a specially designed confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) approach with new data from two sets of 23 samples from 27 countries (N=10,857). In both data sets, CFAs confirm the 10 basic values, a modified quasi-circumplex rather than a simple circumplex structure, and the claim that values form a motivational continuum.},

WBT extends Heider's cognitive balance theory to encompass multiple weighted attitudes. We validate WBT on empirical data from the 2016 National Election Survey. Furthermore, we develop an opinion dynamics model based on WBT, which, for the first time, is able to generate hyperpolarization and to explain the link between affective and opinion polarization. In addition, our theory encompasses other phenomena of opinion dynamics, including mono-polarization and backfire effects.},

Preserving these quantities of the random-regular network, a true random network can be generated from the \$G(n,p)\$ model after determining the link probability \$p\$.

While previous studies have shown that noninvariance is a problem for comparative research and pointed out methods to alleviate the risks of drawing invalid conclusions, none has so far tried to explain why measurements of gender role attitudes are nonequivalent. Therefore, we use multilevel structural equation modeling to exploring measurement invariance and explain its absence. We use data assessing peoples' views on the specialization of roles by gender and the consequences of female employment on family's well-being from the International Social Survey Programme. We can replicate the findings from prior research indicating that scalar measurement invariance across countries is absent. Furthermore, we use two country-level variables to explain the noninvariance of particular items. The cultural value embeddedness explains noninvariance to a considerable degree while the Gender Inequality Index from the United Nations Development Programme does not. Therefore, we conclude that issues of comparability of gender role attitudes are related mainly to cultural rather than structural differences between countries.},

Moving beyond this approach, a burgeoning line of research is investigating temporal dyadic similarity on traits and behaviors, such as health activities. Our study contributes to this line of inquiry by using fine-grained longitudinal data obtained from sensors, mobile devices, and surveys to examine whether we can observe distinct types of dyadic similarity trajectories based on physical activity, and if so, what dyad-level properties predict membership in each trajectory class. Treating daily differences in the steps for dyads as time series, we use k-shape clustering to identify classes of similarity trajectories and logistic regression to examine the link between trajectory class and key dyad-level factors. We identify 21 dyadic trajectory clusters and find that trajectory membership predicts dyadic connectivity in the communication network, as well as racial and religious\textemdash but not gender-based\textemdash similarity. We conclude by noting how research on dyadic similarity trajectories can be further integrated with ongoing work in social network analysis.},

One important facet of network analysis that receives significant attention is community detection. However, while most community detection algorithms focus on clustering the actors of the network, it is very intuitive to cluster the edges. Connections exist because they were formed within some latent environment such as, in the case of a social network, a workplace or religious group, and hence by clustering the edges of a network we may gain some insight into these latent environments. We propose a model-based approach to clustering the edges of a network using a latent space model describing the features of both actors and latent environments. We derive a generalized EM algorithm for estimation and gradient-based Monte Carlo algorithms, and we demonstrate that the computational cost grows linearly in the number of actors for sparse networks rather than quadratically. We demonstrate the potential impact of our proposed approach on a patient transfer network, verifying these results by running simple epidemic simulations, and on a real friendship network amongst faculty members at a university in the United Kingdom.},

Several community-based QA (CQA) services have emerged allowing information seekers pose their information need as questions and receive answers from their fellow users. A question may receive multiple answers from multiple users and the asker or the community can choose the best answer. While the asker can thus indicate if he was satisfied with the information he received, there is no clear way of evaluating the quality of that information. We present a study to evaluate and predict the quality of an answer in a CQA setting. We chose Yahoo! Answers as such CQA service and selected a small set of questions, each with at least five answers. We asked Amazon Mechanical Turk workers to rate the quality of each answer for a given question based on 13 different criteria. Each answer was rated by five different workers. We then matched their assessments with the actual asker's rating of a given answer. We show that the quality criteria we used faithfully match with asker's perception of a quality answer. We furthered our investigation by extracting various features from questions, answers, and the users who posted them, and training a number of classifiers to select the best answer using those features. We demonstrate a high predictability of our trained models along with the relative merits of each of the features for such prediction. These models support our argument that in case of CQA, contextual information such as a user's profile, can be critical in evaluating and predicting content quality.},

  abstract = {The Gaussian graphical model has been a popular tool for investigating the conditional dependency structure between random variables by estimating sparse precision matrices. The estimated precision matrices can be mapped into networks for visualization. However, the ability to investigate the conditional dependency structure when a two-level structure exists among the variables is still limited. Some variables are considered as higher-level variables while others are nested in these higher-level variables\textemdash the latter are called lower-level variables. For instance, genes are grouped into pathways for particular functions, so that pathways are the higher-level variables and genes within the pathways are the lower-level variables. Higher-level variables are not isolated; instead, they work together to accomplish certain tasks. Therefore, our main interest is to simultaneously explore conditional dependency structures among higher-level variables and among lower-level variables. Given two-level data from heterogeneous classes, we propose a method to jointly estimate the two-level Gaussian graphical models across multiple classes, so that common structures in terms of the two-level conditional dependency are shared during the estimation procedure, yet unique structures for each class are retained as well. Our proposed approach is achieved by first introducing higher-level variable factors within classes and then introducing common factors across classes. The performance of our approach is evaluated on several simulated networks. We also demonstrate the advantages of our approach using breast cancer patient data. {$<$}a class="ext-link" href="https://doi.org/10.1080/10618600.2019.1694522"{$>$}Supplementary materials{$<$}/a{$>$} for this article are available online.},

Our software is designed to be robust, modular, and extensible, providing the ability to model dynamic social network topologies and multidimensional diffusion processes, different styles of agent including non-homophilic paradigms, as well as a testing environment for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) experiments with diverse sets of agent types.

However, the success of such attempts relies on the level of trust that members have with each other as well as with the service provider. Therefore, trust becomes an essential and important element of a successful social network.

We first review the existing definitions of trust and define social trust in the context of social networks. We then discuss recent works addressing three aspects of social trust: trust information collection, trust evaluation, and trust dissemination.

  abstract = {Electoral outcomes in both established and new democracies alike generate a flurry of interest and analysis. However, the reasons to vote or not are varied. Herein lays a large part of the problem in trying to provide a single explanation for declining turnout for an entire country. In different places within a country different mixes of reasons may be at work. This geographic analysis of voter turnout focuses upon contemporary Italian democracy. Italy is a compelling case in which to examine the relationship between demography and democracy for several reasons. First, Italy is renowned for its historically high voter turnout rates. In the eighteen national elections since 1948, well over 80~\% of voters turned out in each and every political contest. Second, as alluded to previously, Italy has one of the highest proportions of citizens aged 65 and over in the world. Coupled with one of the world's lowest birthrates, it is projected that Italy will experience a significant population decline in the decades to come. Third, Italy is often considered to be divided into two distinct geographic regions: a prosperous, civic-minded and European-oriented north versus an underdeveloped, peripheral, stagnant and corrupt south. Sub-divisions of this twofold division are also very common, as we discuss later. Fourth, the economic crisis of 2008 ushered in a remarkable period of social, political and economic turmoil across the Eurozone, and resulted in several austerity measures, some of which have been particularly acute for Italy and many Italians. Finally, the 2013 general election marked low-points in terms of voter turnout, and more generally, public attitudes towards Italian politics and politicians. Recognizing how such factors influence political participation differently in different places across Italy will shed light on the age-turnout nexus, and highlight the value of incorporating spatial concepts and theories into demographic-based accounts of politics.},

We performed experiments involving a novel scenario simulating an unpredictable situation faced by a group in which 2480 subjects in 108 groups had to both communicate information and decide whether to `evacuate'. We manipulated the permissible sorts of interpersonal communication and varied group topology and size. Compared to groups of isolated individuals, we find that communication networks suppress necessary evacuations because of the spontaneous and diffuse emergence of false reassurance; yet, communication networks also restrain unnecessary evacuations in situations without disasters. At the individual level, subjects have thresholds for responding to social information that are sensitive to the negativity, but not the actual accuracy, of the signals being transmitted. Social networks can function poorly as pathways for inconvenient truths that people would rather ignore.},

Democratic elections are one such behaviour. Over the past few decades, physicists have explored scaling patterns in voting and the dynamics of political opinion formation (for example, see refs. 8\textendash 13). Here, we define the concepts of negative representation, in which a shift in electorate opinions produces a shift in the election outcome in the opposite direction, and electoral instability, in which an arbitrarily small change in electorate opinions can dramatically swing the election outcome, and prove that unstable elections necessarily contain negatively represented opinions. Furthermore, in the presence of low voter turnout, increasing polarization of the electorate can drive elections through a transition from a stable to an unstable regime, analogous to the phase transition by which some materials become ferromagnetic below their critical temperatures. Empirical data suggest that the United States' presidential elections underwent such a phase transition in the 1970s and have since become increasingly unstable.},

Finally, participants were scanned while viewing the clips again, along with novel clips from the same movies. We found that group members' neural activity became more aligned a er conversation, with each group achieving a distinctive pattern of alignment reflecting their unique discussion. This alignment persisted over novel clips, framing new but related information. Finally, we found that participants who were central in their real-world social networks played an outsized role in creating group alignment, both by facilitating conversation and by being more likely to adapt their own brain activity to the group. These results suggest that the e ects of conversation on private thought are a powerful determinant of social influence.

To explore this growth mechanism, we conducted a simulation study to examine the properties of networks grown by inverse preferential attachment, where new nodes added to the network tend to connect to existing nodes with fewer edges. Specifically, we analyzed the network structure and degree distributions of artificial networks generated via either preferential attachment, an inverse variant of preferential attachment, or combinations of both network growth mechanisms. The simulations showed that network growth initially driven by preferential attachment followed by inverse preferential attachment led to densely-connected network structures (i.e., smaller diameters and average shortest path lengths), as well as degree distributions that could be characterized by non-power law distributions, analogous to the features of real-world phonological networks. These results provide converging evidence that inverse preferential attachment may play a role in the development of the phonological lexicon and reflect processing costs associated with a mature lexicon structure.},

  abstract = {A broad set of empirical phenomenon in the study of social, economic and machine behaviour can be modelled as complex systems with averaging dynamics. However many of these models naturally result in consensus or consensus-like outcomes. In reality, empirical phenomenon rarely converge to these and instead are characterized by rich, persistent variation in the agent states. Such heterogeneous outcomes are a natural consequence of a number of models that incorporate external perturbation to the otherwise convex dynamics of the agents. The purpose of this paper is to formalize the notion of heterogeneity and demonstrate which classes of models are able to achieve it as an outcome, and therefore are better suited to modelling important empirical questions. We do so by determining how the topology of (time-varying) interaction networks restrict the space of possible steady-state outcomes for agents, and how this is related to the study of random walks on graphs. We consider a number of intentionally diverse examples to demonstrate how the results can be applied.},

In order to assess our method, we apply it to unveil the differences of social relationships in distinct academic social networks and Q\&amp;A communities. We also validate our social definitions considering the importance of the nodes and edges in a social structure by means of network properties, as well as investigate the robustness of our method by stressing it for dealing with the time existence of the nodes in a network and the randomness of attributes associated with them.

Recent efforts in this direction have characterized culture as a meta-concept, identifying and disentangling its constituent parts. Building on the two- and three-dimensional models that have emerged of late, while also taking stock of the longer history of sociology's struggle to reconceptualize culture after Parsons, we argue that culture is best understood via a four-facet model. Culture, we argue, consists of discourse, which is oriented toward meaning, and practice, which is oriented toward action. But both discourse and practice have implicit and explicit dimensions: they consist of underlying generative structures and concrete manifestations. To demonstrate the four-facet model's value for empirical analysis, we use it to address the high-profile methodological debates that have recently roiled the field, pitting ethnography, interviewing, and survey research against one another as the ideal mode of accessing culture writ large. Rather than arbitrating among methods, we show, the four-facet model specifies how each approach contributes to cultural analysis, facilitating conversation in places where disagreements currently appear intractable and underwriting methodological pluralism.},

Modeling social interactions to understand the underlying mechanism of herd behavior has been a topic of interest for the past several decades. Our focus in this work is to investigate the phenomenon of extreme, unexpected growth and gain in a social network, and how different diffusion models can be used to identify the "key players" in such a process. In social network analysis, it is a tedious task to find the most influential entities, and how ideas or news spread through the network. A popular method to solve this task is to represent the social network as a graph. In a dynamic or an ever-growing social graph, discovering when an idea starts spreading, and not when it started first, reflects the real nature of how viral ideas catch-on in society. Also, instead of locating the root of an idea, it is crucial to see who propelled the idea to the surface, and triggered the spread. In this paper, we develop a method to identify the set of nodes who are responsible for extraordinary change in graph growth. We propose a methodology that allows us to identify the phenomenon called "tipping point", both in terms of the the role of a node or a community in graph growth, but also with respect to the time frame it occurred. Our framework is employing different influence propagation approaches, to locate critical nodes or communities and indicate their role in the early stages of the sudden graph growth. We demonstrate how the methodology is applied using a real-life social network. We aspire that the proposed framework will help researchers better understand this phenomenon and be able to identify agents responsible for spreading trends, beliefs, opinions, etc. in society.},

The emphasis is on synthetic data generation for anomalous detection in complex social networks. In particular, the development of a heuristic generative model, capable of creating data for anomalous rare activities in complex social networks is sought. To this end, lessons from social and political literature are applied to prototype a novel implementation of the Agent-based Modeling (ABM) framework, based on simple social interactions between agents, for synthetic data generation in the context of terrorist profile desegregation. The conclusion offers directions for further verification, fine-tuning, and proposes future directions of work for the ABM prototype, as a complex-societal approach to synthetic data generation, by identifying heuristic hyper-parameter tuning methodologies to further ensure the generated data distribution is similar to the true distribution of the original data-sets. While a rigorous mathematical optimization for reducing the distances in distributions is not offered in this work, we opine that this prototype of an autonomous-agent generative complex social model is useful for studying and researching on pattern of life and anomaly detection where there is strict limitation or lack of sufficient data for using practical machine learning solutions in mission-critical applications.},

  abstract = {Election boycotts are a common occurrence in unconsolidated democracies, particularly in the developing world, with prominent examples from recent years occurring in Venezuela, Zimbabwe, and Ethiopia. Despite the frequent occurrence of boycotts, there are few studies available in the scholarly literature concerning the effectiveness of electoral boycotts, particularly as a strategy of opposition parties seeking to bring about the end of electoral authoritarian governments. This paper is based in the democratization literature, with a particular focus on the behavior and vulnerabilities of hybrid or electoral authoritarian regimes. Using an original dataset with global coverage including hybrid regimes from 1981 to 2006, this paper uses event-history analysis to determine the efficacy of boycotts in national elections among other risk factors thought to undermine electoral authoritarian regimes as well as the possibilities for subsequent democratization occurring following both contested and boycotted electoral processes.},

  abstract = {Introduction Community detection, the process of identifying subgroups of highly connected individuals within a network, is an aspect of social network analysis that is relevant but potentially underutilized in prevention research. Guidance on using community detection methods stresses aligning methods with specific research questions but lacks clear operationalization. The Question Alignment approach was developed to help address this gap and promote the high-quality use of community detection methods. Methods A total of 6 community detection methods are discussed: Walktrap, Edge-Betweenness, Infomap, Louvain, Label Propagation, and Spinglass. The Question Alignment approach is described and demonstrated using real-world data collected in 2013. This hypothetical case study was conducted in 2019 and focused on targeting a hand hygiene intervention to high-risk communities to prevent influenza transmission. Results Community detection using the Walktrap method best fit the hypothetical case study. The communities derived using the Walktrap method were quite different from communities derived through the other 5 methods in both the number of communities and individuals within communities. There was evidence to support that the Question Alignment approach can help researchers produce more useful community detection results. Compared to other methods of selecting high-risk groups, the Walktrap produced the most communities that met the hypothetical intervention requirements. Conclusions As prevention research incorporating social networks increases, researchers can use the Question Alignment approach to produce more theoretically meaningful results and potentially more useful results for practice. Future research should focus on assessing whether the Question Alignment approach translates into improved intervention results.},

Using standard network measures, the topology of 110 networks across a variety of disciplines shows agreement with a simple two-parameter model based on this theory. Importantly, we show that the log-normal surface factor can explain the power-law-like degree distributions of sparse networks and, more strongly, the variety of degree distributions found across networks of different densities. We also demonstrate how inverting an estimated surface factor of a complete weighted world city network provides more plausible clusters of nodes than the original network based on geometric and cultural considerations.

  abstract = {Most of the opinion dynamics models in sociophysics have their historic origin in studies two-dimensional magnetization phenomena. This metaphor has proven quite useful, as it allowed to use well known techniques, relating individual behaviours of single spins and their interactions, to large scale properties, such as magnetization or magnetic domains creation. These physical properties were then ``mapped'' to social concepts: spin orientation to a person's views on a specific issue, magnetization to global opinion on the issue, etc. During the past 20 years, the models were significantly expanded, using more complex individual agent characteristics and even more complex types of the interactions, but the power of the metaphor remained unchanged. In the current paper we propose to use a new physical system as the basis for new ideas in sociophysics. We shall argue that the concepts and tools devoted to studies of High Entropy Alloys (HEAs) could significantly broaden the range of social concepts ``addressable'' by sociophysics, by focusing on a wider range of global phenomena, arising from atomic properties, interactions and arrangements. We illustrate the new idea by calculating a few characteristics of a simple HEA system and their possible ``mapping'' into social concepts.},

However, there is a tendency to overlook aspects related to the context and features of the users during the usability assessment process. This research introduces the concept of mental workload as an aid to enhance usability measurement. A user-study has been designed and executed in the context of human-web interaction. The aim was to investigate the relationship between the perception of usability of three popular web-sites, and the mental workload imposed by a set of typical tasks executed over them. Scores obtained with the System Usability Scale were compared to the mental workload scores obtained from the NASA Task Load Index and the Workload Profile assessment procedures. Findings suggest that perception of usability and mental workload are likely to be two nonoverlapping constructs, and there is no clear evidence of their interaction. They measure two different aspects of human-system interaction and therefore they could be jointly employed to better describe user experience.},

However, the algorithm adopts a random selection scheme in label updating strategy, which results in unstable division and poor accuracy. In this paper, five different indicators of node similarity are introduced based on network local information to distinguish nodes and a new label updating method is proposed. When there are multiple maximum neighbor labels in the propagation process, the maximum label corresponding to the most similar node is selected for updating instead of a random one. Five different forms of improved LPA are proposed which are named as SAL-LPA, SOR-LPA, JAC-LPA, SOR-LPA, HDI-LPA and HPI-LPA. The experiment results on real-world and artificial benchmark networks show that the improved LPA greatly improves the performance of the original algorithm, among which HPI-LPA is the best.},

Previous research (Critcher et al., 2011; Tetlock et al., 2000) demonstrated that tragic and taboo trade-offs are not only evaluated by their outcomes, but are also evaluated based on the time it took to make the choice. We investigate two outstanding questions: 1) whether the effect of decision time differs for evaluations of decisions compared to decision makers and 2) whether moral contexts are unique in their ability to influence character evaluations through decision process information. In two experiments (total N = 1434) we find that decision time affects character evaluations, but not evaluations of the decision itself. There were no significant differences between tragic trade-offs and secular trade-offs, suggesting that the decisions structure may be more important in evaluations than moral context. Additionally, the magnitude of the effect of decision time shows us that decision time, may be of less practical use than expected. We thus urge, to take a closer examination of the processes underlying decision time and its perception.},

Uncovering the community structure exhibited by real networks is a crucial step towards a better understanding of complex systems, revealing the internal organization of nodes. However, existing algorithms in the literature up-to-date present several crucial issues, and the question of how good an algorithm is, with respect to others, is still open. Recently, Newman [14] suggested modularity as a natural measure of the goodness of network community decompositions. Here we propose an implementation of an Immunological Algorithm, a population based computational systems inspired by the immune system and its features, to perform community detection on the methods of modularity maximization. The reliability and efficiency of the proposed algorithm has been validate by comparing it with Louvain algorithm one of the fastest and the popular algorithm based on a multiscale modularity optimization scheme.},

Most of the approaches to graph topology learning are based on the assumption of graph Laplacian sparsity, with various additional constraints, followed by variations of the edge weights in the graph domain or the eigenvalues in the graph spectral domain. These domains are high-dimensional, since their dimension is at least equal to the order of the number of vertices. In this paper, we propose a numerically efficient method for estimating of the normalized Laplacian through its eigenvalues estimation and by promoting its sparsity. The minimization problem is solved in quite a low-dimensional space, related to the polynomial order of the underlying system on a graph corresponding to the the observed data. The accuracy of the results is tested on numerical example.}

Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that participants assume their ideological opponents, in comparison to their ideological allies, are less likely to have good reasons for their positions. Moreover, we found that the more strongly participants believe their opponents lack good reasons for their positions, the more likely they are to report that those opponents lack both intellectual capabilities and moral character.

(2) If relative deprivation enters the individual's utility function approximately linearly then, holding constant individual \emph{i}'s wealth and the average wealth of the individuals who are wealthier than he is, the individual's relative risk aversion decreases when he becomes more relatively deprived as a result of a decline in his rank. Our findings provide a theoretical support for evidence about the propensity of relatively deprived individuals to gamble and resort to other risky behaviors.},

We started from this multidimensionality to understand how the relative importance of human values varies through the different dimensions of gender inequality - namely work, money, knowledge, time, power, and health. Through a crosssectional design that includes 18 European countries and the use of Bayesian correlational analysis, the findings seemed to outline three groups of values: (1) universalism, benevolence and self-direction are strongly and positively correlated to gender equality; (2) security, power and achievement are strongly and negatively correlated to equality while (3) conformity, tradition, stimulation, and hedonism have weak/non-significant correlation coefficients with gender equality. Relevance to cultural values and ideologies that support social equality are discussed. Furthermore, the specificities of some values find an explanation in relation to certain dimensions. The widening of the perspective on gender equality rectifies the previous findings by outlining a more complex scenario than the one previously identified, where the results included only two groups of values.},

Whereas the structural equation modeling literature has emphasized that a comparison of latent means presupposes equal factor loadings and indicator intercepts for most of the indicators (i.e., partial invariance), it is still unknown if partial invariance is sufficient when relying on observed composites. This Monte Carlo study investigated whether one or two unequal factor loadings and indicator intercepts in a composite can lead to wrong conclusions regarding latent mean differences. Results show that unequal indicator intercepts substantially affect the composite mean difference and the probability of a significant composite difference. In contrast, unequal factor loadings demonstrate only small effects. It is concluded that analyses of composite differences are only warranted in conditions of full measurement invariance, and the author recommends the analyses of latent mean differences with structural equation modeling instead.},

  abstract = {In the digital economy, innovation processes increasingly rely on highly specialised know-how and open-source software shared on digital platforms on collaborative programming. The information that feeds into the content on these platforms is provided voluntarily by a vast crowd of knowledgeable users from all over the world. In contributing to the platforms, users invest their time and share knowledge with strangers to add to the rising body of digital knowledge. This requires an open mindset and trust. In this study, we argue that such a mindset is not just an individual asset, but determined by the local communities the users are embedded in. We, therefore, hypothesise that places with higher levels of trust should contribute more to Stack Overflow, the world's largest question-and-answer platform for programming questions. In relating the city-level contributions of 266 OECD metropolitan areas to infrastructure, economic, and trust measures, we find this hypothesis confirmed. In contrast, click rates to the platform are solely driven by infrastructure and economic variables, but not by trust. These findings highlight the importance of societal values in the 21st century knowledge economy: if policymakers want to develop a lively local digital economy, it is not enough to provide fast Internet access and business opportunities. Instead, it is equally important to establish a trust-building environment that fosters sharing of innovative ideas, collaborations, and knowledge spillovers.

However, the application of statistical network models within large-scale community research is hindered by too little understanding of the validity of their inferences under realistic data collection conditions, including sampled or missing network data. The autologistic actor attribute model (ALAAM) is a statistical model based on the well-established exponential random graph model (ERGM) for social networks. ALAAMs can be regarded as a social influence model, predicting an individual-level outcome based on the actor's network ties, concurrent outcomes of his/her network partners, and attributes of the actor and his/her network partners. In particular, an ALAAM can be used to measure contagion effects, that is, the propensity of two actors connected by a social network tie to both have the same value of an attribute. We investigate the effect of using simple random samples and snowball samples of network data on ALAAM parameter inference, and find that parameter inference can still work well even with a nontrivial fraction of missing nodes. However it is safer to take a snowball sample of the network and estimate conditional on the snowball sampling structure.},

Word embedding models overcome this problem by constructing a standardized meaning space where words are assigned a location based on relations of similarity to, and difference from, other words based on how they are used in natural language samples. We show how word embeddings can be put to the task of interpretation via two kinds of navigation. First, one can hold terms constant and measure how the embedding space moves around them--much like astronomers measured the changing of celestial bodies with the seasons. Second, one can also hold the embedding space constant and see how documents or authors move relative to it--just as ships use the stars on a given night to determine their location. Using the empirical case of immigration discourse in the United States, we demonstrate the merits of these two broad strategies to advance formal approaches to cultural analysis.},

They also may differ in terms of the duration and persistence of attitudes, with some persons' beliefs being much more stable than others.

Attitudinal stability is operationalized as a construct called response consistency, which is indicated by the concordance of observed responses between two-time points. A simulation experiment assesses the parameter recovery of the proposed model. A real data analysis example uses data collected from a study on folklore beliefs about diabetes (563 individuals from multiple rural communities in North Carolina). On two different occasions, the individuals in the sample completed a 31-item common-sense model of diabetes inventory, which measures the congruence of their beliefs with a biomedical model. Results from the simulation study showed that the model parameters and factor correlation in the latent bivariate IRT model overall recovered well. Results from the real data analysis demonstrated the saliency of the construct. A weak association between having beliefs congruent with the biomedical model and response consistency across the two administrations was found.},

  abstract = {Here we propose a new method to compare the modular structure of a pair of node-aligned networks. The majority of current methods, such as normalized mutual information, compare two node partitions derived from a community detection algorithm yet ignore the respective underlying network topologies. Addressing this gap, our method deploys a community detection quality function to assess the fit of each node partition with respect to the other network's connectivity structure. Specifically, for two networks A and B, we project the node partition of B onto the connectivity structure of A. By evaluating the fit of B's partition relative to A's own partition on network A (using a standard quality function), we quantify how well network A describes the modular structure of B. Repeating this in the other direction, we obtain a two-dimensional distance measure, the bi-directional (BiDir) distance. The advantages of our methodology are three-fold. First, it is adaptable to a wide class of community detection algorithms that seek to optimize an objective function. Second, it takes into account the network structure, specifically the strength of the connections within and between communities, and can thus capture differences between networks with similar partitions but where one of them might have a more defined or robust community structure. Third, it can also identify cases in which dissimilar optimal partitions hide the fact that the underlying community structure of both networks is relatively similar. We illustrate our method for a variety of community detection algorithms, including multi-resolution approaches, and a range of both simulated and real world networks.},

We study opinion dynamics in tie-decay networks, in which tie strength increases instantaneously when there is an interaction and decays exponentially between interactions. Specifically, we formulate continuous-time Laplacian dynamics and a discrete-time DeGroot model of opinion dynamics in tie-decay networks, and we carry out numerical computations for the continuous-time Laplacian dynamics. We examine the speed of convergence by studying the spectral gap of combinatorial Laplacian matrices of tie-decay networks. First, we examine the spectral gaps of tie-decay networks from empirical data. Intuitively, we expect small tie-decay rates to lead to fast convergence, because the influence of each interaction event between a pair of nodes lasts longer for smaller decay rates. Moreover, as time progresses and more interaction events occur, we expect to observe convergence to proceed. However, we demonstrate that the spectral gaps need not decrease monotonically with respect to the decay rate or increase monotonically with respect to time. Second, we compare the spectral gaps of these empirical networks with corresponding randomized and aggregate networks. We find that the spectral gaps of the empirical networks tend to be smaller than those of the randomized and aggregate networks. This highlights the importance of the interplay between the times that edges arise and decay in temporal networks.},

Relying on the new concept, CDME has many desirable properties. It allows uncovering high-quality communities driven by dynamic CDME is also parameter free. More importantly, since CDME works in a local way and only needs to calculate the attractiveness of neighboring nodes, which lend itself to handling large-scale networks.

However, main graph clustering schemes such as spectral clustering cannot be applied to a large network due to prohibitive computational complexity required. While there exist methods applicable to large networks, these methods do not offer convincing comparisons against known ground truth. For the first time, this work conducts clustering algorithm performance evaluations on large networks (consisting of one million nodes) with ground truth information. Ideas and concepts from game theory are applied towards graph clustering to formulate a new proposed algorithm, Game Theoretical Approach for Clustering (GTAC). This theoretical framework is shown to be a generalization of both the Label Propagation and Louvain methods, offering an additional means of derivation and analysis. GTAC introduces a tuning parameter which allows variable algorithm performance in accordance with application needs. Experimentation shows that these GTAC algorithms offer scalability and tunability towards big data applications.}

Two models of cultural influence are developed, for settled and unsettled cultural periods. In settled periods, culture independently influences action, but only by providing resources from which people can construct diverse lines of action. In unsettled cultural periods, explicit ideologies directly govern action, but structural opportunities for action determine which among competing ideologies survive in the long run. This alternative view of culture offers new opportunities for systematic, differentiated arguments about culture's causal role in shaping action.]},

  abstract = {LGBT rights have come to be seen as allied with the idea of ``Europe'' and a European identity, particularly in the process of European Union enlargement to the East. Scholars have examined the ways in which external norms interact with more local, often ``traditional'' norms and identities. In this process, nationalism and conceptions of national identity and gender/sexuality norms can be seen as important factors that influence the domestic adoption of LGBT rights, particularly in the post-war Balkans. Croatia and Serbia (from approximately 2000 to 2014) present two interesting and different cases to analyze how discourses and dynamics of national and state identity construction, nationalism, and LGBT rights relate to discourses of ``Europeanness'' and European identity and how these affect the political dynamics of LGBT rights. This article finds that in Croatia, national identity was constructed in terms of convergence with European norms and identity, homonationalism was used to distinguish themselves from a ``Balkan'' identity, and there was a lower threat perception of the LGBT community framed primarily as a ``threat to the family.'' In Serbia, state and national identity was constructed in opposition to Europe and homosexuality had stronger threat perception, framed primarily as ``threat to the nation.'' In short, nationalism and national identity were less disadvantageous as a domestic constraint to LGBT rights in Croatia than in Serbia. The dynamics between nationalism and LGBT rights played out, for example, in the politics of the marriage referendum, Pride Parades, and public discourse more generally. This research contributes to the scholarship on LGBT rights and nationalism by empirically analyzing the different ways that nationalism, gender/sexuality, and European identity interrelate and influence LGBT rights change in a changing post-war identity landscape and how domestic constraints affect human rights norm diffusion.},

Five patterns of social structures including the trade-off law emerged depending on the strengths of the memory mechanisms. This suggests how communication systems construct different social structures. These results provide insight into the design of online social networks.},

  abstract = {Real-world social networks often exhibit high levels of clustering, positive degree assortativity, short average path lengths (small-world property) and bounded, which means not scale-free, degree distributions. At the same time homophily, defined as the propensity of similar agents to connect to each other, is one of the characteristic features observed in many human and animal societies. In this paper we examine an extent to which homophily may be considered an important force generating and structuring social networks. To do so, we conduct a simulation study based on Social Distance Attachment (SDA) network model in which nodes are embedded in an abstract social space and connection probabilities depend functionally on distances between nodes. We find that homophily, especially when combined with random edge rewiring, can reproduce many of the characteristic features of social networks. Additionally, we devise a hybrid model combining SDA with configuration model that allows to generate homophily-driven networks with arbitrary degree distributions and we use it to study interactions of homophily with processes imposing constraints on degree distributions. We show that the effects of homophily on clustering are robust with respect to distribution constraints, while degree assortativity can be highly dependent on the particular kind of enforced degree sequence. Numerical results are additionally enriched with a review of theoretical and/or analytical arguments supporting both the general geometric approach to social networks and homophily as well as the particular functional form of the connection probability function assumed in SDA model.},

  abstract = {Graph embedding methods are becoming increasingly popular in the machine learning community, where they are widely used for tasks such as node classification and link prediction. Embedding graphs in geometric spaces should aid the identification of network communities as well, because nodes in the same community should be projected close to each other in the geometric space, where they can be detected via standard data clustering algorithms. In this paper, we test the ability of several graph embedding techniques to detect communities on benchmark graphs. We compare their performance against that of traditional community detection algorithms. We find that the performance is comparable, if the parameters of the embedding techniques are suitably chosen. However, the optimal parameter set varies with the specific features of the benchmark graphs, like their size, whereas popular community detection algorithms do not require any parameter. So it is not possible to indicate beforehand good parameter sets for the analysis of real networks. This finding, along with the high computational cost of embedding a network and grouping the points, suggests that, for community detection, current embedding techniques do not represent an improvement over network clustering algorithms.},

We find communities in the framework of the semidefinite programming (SDP) method. In practical applications, the distribution of some node attributes may be uncorrelated with the network structure or the network itself may contain no communities as in a random graph. A sparse attribute self-adjustment mechanism is introduced to determine the relative importance of each source of information. As a by product, our method is also effective for community detection of multilayer networks that allow for multiple kinds of relations over the same set of nodes. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Though there is no spatial correlation in the outcome equation (the mean equation), the spatial autoregressive process defined for the logvolatility terms introduces spatial dependence in the outcome equation. To introduce a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) estimation algorithm, we transform the model so that the outcome equation takes the form of log-squared terms. We approximate the distribution of the log-squared error terms in the outcome equation with a finite mixture of normal distributions so that the transformed model turns into a linear Gaussian state-space model. Our simulation results indicate that the Bayesian estimator has satisfactory finite sample properties. We investigate the practical usefulness of our proposed model and estimation method by using the price returns of residential properties in the broader Chicago Metropolitan area.},

Respondents can then be sorted into ``classes'' on the basis of the schema to which their survey response patterns best align. In this article, we extend this ``schematic class analysis'' method to text data. We introduce concept class analysis (CoCA): a hybrid model that combines word embeddings and correlational class analysis to group documents across a corpus by the similarity of schemas recovered from them. We introduce the CoCA model, illustrate its validity and utility using simulations, and conclude with considerations for future research and applications.},

Whether increased access can induce larger amounts of societal separation is important to investigate, and this work sheds further insight into the phenomenon. Center to the hypothesis of homophilic alignments in friendship generation is that of a discussion group or community. These are modeled and the investigation into their effect on the dynamics of polarization is presented. The social implications demonstrate that initial phases of an ideological exchange can result in increased polarization, although a consensus in the long run is expected and that the separation between groups is amplified when groups are constructed with ideological homophilic preferences.},

This modification allows us to use the EM algorithm to learn parmeters and to forecast,even in situations where some data is missing. This modification, in conjunction with the graphicalmodel approach, also allows us to include cross predictors in situations where there are multiple times series and/or additional nontemporal covariates.

  abstract = {Identification of community structures and the underlying semantic characteristics of communities are essential tasks in complex network analysis. However, most methods proposed so far are typically only applicable to assortative community structures, that is, more links within communities and fewer links between different communities, which ignore the rich diversity of community regularities in real networks. In addition, the node attributes that provide rich semantics information of communities and networks can facilitate in-depth community detection of structural information. In this paper, we propose a novel unified Bayesian generative model to detect generalized communities and provide semantic descriptions simultaneously by combining network topology and node attributes. The proposed model is composed of two closely correlated parts by a transition matrix; we first apply the concept of a mixture model to describe network regularities and then adjust the classic Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model to identify community semantically. Thus, the model can detect broad types of network structure regularities, including assortative structures, disassortative structures, and mixture structures and provide multiple semantic descriptions for the communities. To optimize the objective function of the model, we use an effective Gibbs sampling algorithm. Experiments on a number of synthetic and real networks show that our model has superior performance compared with some baselines on community detection.},

  abstract = {Gaussian graphical models (GGMs) are a popular method for analysing complex data by modelling the unique relationships between variables. Recently, a shift in interest has taken place from investigating relationships within a (sub)discipline (e.g. genetics) to estimating relationships between variables from various subdisciplines (e.g. how gene expression relates to cognitive performance). It is thus not surprising that there is an increasing need for analysing large, so-called multi-source datasets, each containing detailed information from many data sources on the same individuals. GGMs are a straightforward statistical candidate for estimating unique cross-source relationships from such network-oriented data. However, the multi-source nature of the data poses two challenges: First, different sources may inherently differ from one another, biasing the estimation of the relations. Second, GGMs are not cut out for separating cross-source relationships from all other, source-specific relationships. In this paper we propose the addition of a simultaneous-component-model pre-processing step to the Gaussian graphical model, the combination of which is suitable for estimating cross-source relationships from multi-source data. Compared to the graphical lasso (a commonly used GGM technique), this Sparse Network and Component (SNAC) model more accurately estimates the unique cross-source relationships from multi-source data. This holds in particular when the multi-source data contains more variables than observations (p {$>$} n). Neither differences in sparseness of the underlying component structure of the data nor in the relative dominance of the cross-source compared to source-specific relationships strongly affect the relationship estimates. Sparse Network and Component analysis, a hybrid component-graphical model, is a promising tool for modelling unique relationships between different data sources, thus providing insight into how various disciplines are connected to one another.},

  abstract = {Humans' interactions with each other or with socially competent machines exhibit lawful coordination patterns at multiple levels of description. According to Coordination Dynamics, such laws specify the flow of coordination states produced by functional synergies of elements (e.g., cells, body parts, brain areas, people. . .) that are temporarily organized as single, coherent units. These coordinative structures or synergies may be mathematically characterized as informationally coupled self-organizing dynamical systems (Coordination Dynamics). In this paper, we start from a simple foundation, an elemental model system for social interactions, whose behavior has been captured in the Haken-Kelso-Bunz (HKB) model. We follow a tried and tested scientific method that tightly interweaves experimental neurobehavioral studies and mathematical models. We use this method to further develop a body of empirical research that advances the theory toward more generalized forms. In concordance with this interdisciplinary spirit, the present paper is written both as an overview of relevant advances and as an introduction to its mathematical underpinnings. We demonstrate HKB's evolution in the context of social coordination along several directions, with its applicability growing to increasingly complex scenarios. In particular, we show that accommodating for symmetry breaking in intrinsic dynamics and coupling, multiscale generalization and adaptation are principal evolutions. We conclude that a general framework for social coordination dynamics is on the horizon, in which models support experiments with hypothesis generation and mechanistic insights.},

The key component of this approach is using electoral volatility as a baseline measure for computing party localization indices. For the purposes of this study, conventional definition of localization as non-uniform territorial political response (Caramani, 2004) is redefined as non-uniform, but spatially contingent responses of territorial units to national political forces. Using network analysis, the authors introduce quantitative approach for studying spatial and dynamical aspects of party systems and demonstrate its usefulness and applicability in cases of two post-communist systems: Serbia and Croatia. The results demonstrate that different components of party systems (new versus stable parties) exhibit different levels of nationalization and localization, which has been overlooked in previous studies. In line with previous research (Bochsler, 2010c; Golosov, 2016; Schakel, 2017), this study confirms that the Croatian party system is less nationalized than Serbian, but there are some similarities between the two countries in terms of the distribution of electoral volatility. In the discussion part of the study, limitations of new methodology are explained and directions for its further development are outlined.},

  abstract = {Electoral forecasting is an ongoing scientific challenge with high social impact, as current data-driven methods try to efficiently combine statistics with economic indices and machine learning. However, recent studies in network science pinpoint towards the importance of temporal characteristics in the diffusion of opinion. As such, we combine concepts of micro-scale opinion dynamics and temporal epidemics, and develop a novel macro-scale temporal attenuation (TA) model, which uses pre-election poll data to improve forecasting accuracy. Our hypothesis is that the timing of publicizing opinion polls plays a significant role in how opinion oscillates, especially right before elections. Thus, we define the momentum of opinion as a temporal function which bounces up when opinion is injected in a system of voters, and dampens down during states of relaxation. We validate TA on survey data from the US Presidential Elections between 1968\textendash 2016, and TA outperforms statistical methods, as well the best pollsters at their time, in 10 out of 13 presidential elections. We present two different implementations of the TA model, which accumulate an average forecasting error of 2.8\textendash 3.28 points over the 48year period. Conversely, statistical methods accumulate 7.48 points error, and the best pollsters accumulate 3.64 points. Overall, TA offers increases of 23-37\% in forecasting performance compared to the state of the art. We show that the effectiveness of TA does not drop when relatively few polls are available; moreover, with increasing availability of pre-election surveys, we believe that our TA model will become a reference alongside other modern election forecasting techniques.},

In terms of electoral forecasting, we find several prediction solutions that try to combine statistics with economic indices, and machine learning, like multilevel regression and post-stratification (MRP). Nevertheless, recent studies pinpoint toward the importance of temporal characteristics in the diffusion of opinion. As such, we take inspiration from micro-scale temporal epidemic models and develop an original time-aware (TA) forecasting methodology which is able to improve the prediction of opinion distribution in an electoral context. After a parametric analysis, we validate our TA method with pre-election survey data from three presidential elections (2012\textendash 2019) and the UK Brexit (2016). Benchmarking our TA method against two classic statistical approaches, like survey averaging (SA), and cumulative vote counting (CC), and the best pollster predictions, we find that our method is substantially closer to the real election outcomes. On average, we measure prediction errors of 9.8\% (SA), 9.6\% (CC), 5.1\% (MRP), and only 3.0\% for TA; these differences translate into increases of prediction accuracy of \$\$\textbackslash approx 71\textbackslash\%\$\${$\approx$}71\% for the TA method (40\% better than best pollsters). Moreover, TA does not require socio-economical contextual information, while the more complex MRP method depends on them for prediction. This work builds upon existing studies on the microscopic temporal dynamics of social networks and offers new insight on how macroscopic prediction can be improved using time-awareness.},

In the present research, we shed light on the role attitudinal ambivalence plays in interpersonal liking. Specifically, we examine whether people express ambivalence strategically to generate a positive or negative social image, and whether this is dependent on the attitudinal ambivalence of their perceiver. We test two alternative hypotheses. In line with the attitude-similarity effect, people should express ambivalence towards ambivalent others to enhance interpersonal liking, as sharing ambivalence might socially validate the latter's experience of attitudinal conflict. On the other hand, people might express more univalence, as ambivalence may drive ambivalent others towards the resolution of their attitudinal conflict and univalent stances could help to achieve that goal. In two studies (N = 449, 149), people expressed similar attitudes to those of their perceivers, even when the latter experienced attitudinal conflict (Study 1 and 2). Moreover, they composed an essay, the message of which validated their perceiver's attitudinal conflict (Study 2). In line with these results, we further observe that the more people experienced their ambivalence as conflicting, the more they liked others who similarly experienced attitudinal conflict (Study 1). These findings suggest that the expression of ambivalence can have important interpersonal functions, as it might lead to an enhanced social image when interacting with those coping with attitudinal conflict.},

Using six waves of the European Social Survey, an extension of multilevel analysis is used which combines both a cross-national comparative and a dynamic analysis of values. The hierarchical data structure and the covariates for value endorsement are defined at three distinct levels: a first level for individuals (with sociodemographic variables, such as age and gender), a second level for country-waves (with time-varying covariates), and a third level for country (with time-invariant covariates). The main aim is to determine if changes in contextual covariates over time are related to value differences between countries over and above contextual time-invariant covariates. High national wealth and low income inequality predicted high Self-Transcendence values and low Conservation values. Low national unemployment rates were associated with less conservatism. When entered simultaneously into the model, only time-invariant differences in gross domestic product (GDP) remained to be a significant predictor of Schwartz's two basic value dimensions. Finally, we found that an increase in income inequality over time has a certain incremental effect on the endorsement of Conservation over Openness-to-Change values. There were no associations for changes in national wealth and unemployment rates, suggesting that for value endorsement, time-varying contextual effects are less important overall than time-invariant contextual effects.},

  abstract = {Policy evaluation studies, which aim to assess the effect of an intervention, imply some statistical challenges: real-world scenarios provide treatments which have not been assigned randomly and the analysis might be further complicated by the presence of interference between units. Researchers have started to develop novel methods that allow to manage spillover mechanisms in observational studies, under binary treatments. But many policy evaluation studies require complex treatments, such as multi-valued treatments. For instance, in political sciences, evaluating the impact of policies implemented by administrative entities often implies a multi-valued approach, as the general political stance towards a specific issue varies over many dimensions. In this work, we extend the statistical framework about causal inference under network interference in observational studies, allowing for a multi-valued individual treatment and an interference structure shaped by a weighted network. Under multi-valued treatment, each unit is exposed to all levels of the treatment, due to the influence of his neighbors, according to the network weights. The estimation strategy is based on a joint multiple generalized propensity score and allows to estimate direct effects, controlling for both individual and network covariates. We follow the proposed methodology to analyze the impact of national immigration policy on crime rates. We define a multi-valued characterization of political attitudes towards migrants and we assume that the extent to which each country can be influenced by another is modeled by an appropriate indicator, that we call Interference Compound Index (ICI). Results suggest that implementing highly restrictive immigration policies leads to an increase of crime rates and the magnitude of estimated effects is stronger if we take into account multi-valued interference.},

  abstract = {While exploratory factor analysis (EFA) provides a more realistic presentation of the data with the allowance of item cross-loadings, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) includes many methodological advances that the former does not. To create a synergy of the two, exploratory structural equation modeling (ESEM) was proposed as an alternative solution, incorporating the advantages of EFA and CFA. The present investigation is thus an illustrative demonstration of the applicability and flexibility of ESEM. To achieve this goal, we compared CFA and ESEM models, then thoroughly tested measurement invariance and differential item functioning through multiple-indicators-multiple-causes (MIMIC) models on the Passion Scale, the only measure of the Dualistic Model of Passion which differentiates between harmonious and obsessive forms of passion. Moreover, a hybrid model was also created to overcome the drawbacks of the two methods. Analyses of the first large community sample (N = 7,466; 67.7\% females; Mage = 26.01) revealed that the superiority of the ESEM model relative to CFA in terms of improved goodness-of-fit and less correlated factors, while at the same time retaining the high definition of the factors. However, this fit was only achieved with the inclusion of three correlated uniquenesses, two of which appeared in previous studies and one of which was specific to the current investigation. These findings were replicated on a second, comprehensive sample (N = 504; 51.8\% females; Mage = 39.59). After combining the two samples, complete measurement invariance (factor loadings, factor correlations, item uniquenesses, item intercepts, and latent means) was achieved across gender and partial invariance across age groups and their combination. Only one item intercept was non-invariant across both multigroup and MIMIC approaches, an observation that was further corroborated by the hybrid model. While obsessive passion showed a slight decline in the hybrid model, harmonious passion did not. Overall, the ESEM framework is a viable alternative of CFA that could be used and even extended to address substantially important questions and researchers should systematically compare these two approaches to identify the most suitable one.},

  abstract = {Network inference is the reverse-engineering problem of inferring graphs from data. With the always increasing availability of data, methods based on probability assumptions that infer multiple intertwined networks have been proposed in literature. These methods, while being extremely flexible, have the major drawback of presenting a high number of hyper-parameters that need to be tuned. The tuning of hyper-parameters, in unsupervised settings, can be performed through criteria based on likelihood or stability. Likelihood-based scores can be easily generalised to the multi hyper-parameters setting, but their computation is feasible only under certain probability assumptions. Differently, stability-based methods are of general application and, on single hyper-parameter, they have been proved to outperform likelihood-based scores. In this work we present a multi-parameters extension to stability-based methods that can be easily applied on complex models. We extensively compared this extension with likelihood-based scores on synthetic Gaussian data. Experiments show that our extension provides a better estimate of models of increasing complexity providing a valuable alternative of existing likelihood-based model selection methods.},

Because of their distributed nature, securing user interactions relies rather on trust than hard cryptography. Trust is often based on past user interactions such as in reputation systems relying on ratings. Yet, a more fundamental trust, social trust - assessing a user is genuine with honest intentions - must be established beforehand as many identities can be created easily (i.e., sybils). By leveraging the social network structure and its dynamics (conscious secure pairing and wireless contacts), we propose two complementary approaches for social trust establishment: explicit social trust and implicit social trust. Complexity, trust propagation and security issues are evaluated using real world complex graphs, synthetic mobility models and mobility traces. We show how our approach limits the maximum number of sybils independently of the network size and is more robust against manipulation attacks compared to state-of-the-art approaches such as PGP- like certification chains and distributed community detection algorithms.},

For example, conservative individuals become even more conservative, while liberal individuals become even more liberal. Social psychologists have offered competing explanations for this phenomenon. These typically require questionable assumptions about human psychology. Here, we posit a more parsimonious explanation: the stubbornness of extreme opinions. Using agentbased modeling, we demonstrate that such ``stubborn extremism'' gives rise to group polarization, as well as other trends observed across the literature on polarization. Our study revealed a further methodological problem for the study of group polarization: reporting opinions as categories (e.g. on a Likert scale) inflates the observed increase in opinion extremity. We conclude with a call for deeper integration of opinion dynamics modeling with the cognitive science of communication and influence.},

Bisexual behavior (having sex with both male and female partners) increased from 3.1 to 7.7 \%, accounting for much of the rise, with little consistent change in those having sex exclusively with same-sex partners. The increase in same-sex partners was larger for women than for men, consistent with erotic plasticity theory. Attitudes toward same-sex sexual behavior also became substantially more accepting, d = .75, between the early 1970s and early 2010s. By 2014, 49 \% of American adults believed that same-sex sexual activity was ``not wrong at all,'' up from 11 \% in 1973 and 13 \% in 1990. Controlling for acceptance reduced, but did not eliminate, the increase in same-sex behavior over time. Mixed effects (hierarchical linear modeling) analyses separating age, time period, and cohort showed that the trends were primarily due to time period.

  abstract = {Psychometrics has always been confronted with fundamental criticism, highlighting serious insufficiencies and fallacies. Many fallacies persist, however, because each critic explores only some fallacies while still building on others. This article scrutinizes the epistemological, metatheoretical, and methodological foundations of psychometrics, revealing a complex network of numerous conceptual fallacies underlying its framework of theory and practice. At its core lies a key challenge for psychology: the necessity to distinguish the phenomena under study from the means used to explore them (e.g., concepts, methods, data). This distinction is intricate because concepts constitute psychical phenomena in themselves and many psychical phenomena are accessible only through language-based methods. The analyses show how insufficient consideration of this important distinction and common misconceptions about concepts and language (e.g., signifier\textendash referent conflation, reification of constructs) led to conflations of disparate notions of key terms in psychological measurement (e.g., ``variables'', ``attributes'', ``causality'') and numerous interrelated fallacies (e.g., construct\textendash referent conflation, phenomenon\textendash quality\textendash quantity conflation, numeral\textendash number conflation). These fallacies are maintained and masked by repeated conceptual back-and-forth switching between two incompatible epistemological frameworks, (a) an operationist framework of data modeling implemented through methodical and statistical operations and (b) a realist framework of measurement sporadically invoked in theoretical considerations but neither theoretically elaborated nor empirically implemented. The analyses demonstrate that psychometrics constitutes only data modeling but not data generation or even measurement as often assumed and that analogies to (indirect or fundamental) physical measurement are mistaken. They provide theoretical support for the increasing criticism of psychometrics and its use in research and applied contexts. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)},

This question is important because these processes reflect very different theoretical models of the evolution of ``personal culture.'' That is, if cultural beliefs are primarily public and responsive to external discourse, we should observe more updating as people respond to changes in their local environment. On the other hand, if cultural beliefs are primarily something learned early, then ``settled dispositions'' should be relatively resilient to change. In this paper, we build on Kiley and Vaisey (2020) and introduce an alternative method for distinguishing between cases where respondents appear be actively updating their responses and situations where respondents' responses appear to be settled. This method, based on structural equation modeling, provides a close fit to the theoretical models outlined in Kiley and Vaisey (2020) and provides even stronger support for their claim that most survey responses reflect settled dispositions developed prior to adulthood.},

Expected utility also contains a random (unexplained) component. We assume that, given their restrictions and contact opportunities, individuals evaluate their utility functions and behave such that they maximize the expected amount of utility. The behavior under consideration is the expression of like and dislike (choice of friends). Theoretical mechanisms that are modelled are, e.g., the principle of diminishing returns, the tendency towards reciprocated choices, and the preference for friendship relations with similar others. Constraints imposed on individuals are, e.g., the structure of the existing network, and the distribution of personal characteristics over the respondents.

  abstract = {Preregistration has been lauded as one of the solutions to the so-called `crisis of confidence' in the social sciences and has therefore gained in popularity in recent years. However, despite its growing popularity, preregistration is still in its infancy and preregistration practices are far from optimal. Moreover, the current infrastructure for preregistration is limited and is primarily relevant for studies where new data will be collected. This is unfortunate as preregistering secondary data analyses is crucially important since researchers' hypotheses and analyses may be biased by their prior knowledge of the data, and because the extensive nature of many secondary data sets provide ample opportunity for p-hacking. In this tutorial, we present a template specifically designed for the preregistration of secondary data analyses, and provide comments and a practical example that may help with using the template effectively.},

  abstract = {Linear regression analyses commonly involve two consecutive stages of statistical inquiry. In the first stage, a single `best' model is defined by a specific selection of relevant predictors; in the second stage, the regression coefficients of the winning model are used for prediction and for inference concerning the importance of the predictors. However, such second-stage inference ignores the model uncertainty from the first stage, resulting in overconfident parameter estimates that generalize poorly. These drawbacks can be overcome by model averaging, a technique that retains all models for inference, weighting each model's contribution by its posterior probability. Although conceptually straightforward, model averaging is rarely used in applied research, possibly due to the lack of easily accessible software. To bridge the gap between theory and practice, we provide a tutorial on linear regression using Bayesian model averaging in JASP, based on the BAS package in R. Firstly, we provide theoretical background on linear regression, Bayesian inference, and Bayesian model averaging. Secondly, we demonstrate the method on an example data set from the World Happiness Report. Lastly, we discuss limitations of model averaging and directions for dealing with violations of model assumptions.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}It can be expected that interview speed and straight-lining tendency are related: a higher speed can lead to an increase in cognitive difficulty, which might be coped with by straight-lining; whereas, straight-lining can decrease response latency and hence increase the interview speed. Previous research shows that interview speed is influenced by the interviewer. Straight-lining tendency and other satisficing symptoms have also been shown to be subject to interviewer effects, albeit to a smaller extent. In the first step in this paper, we analyze interviewer effects on interview speed and straight-lining in one module of the European Social Survey, round 7. We then study the correlation between interview speed and straight-lining, without determining causality, and separate this into an interviewer-level and respondent-level correlation. The results confirm previous findings: a large intra-interviewer correlation coefficient for interview speed and a smaller intra-interviewer correlation coefficient for straight-lining. Further, the results show a significant positive correlation in nine out of fifteen countries at the respondent level and in five (different) countries at the interviewer level. The latter indicates that "fast" interviewers are the ones carrying out interviews during which more straight-lining occurs.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

In a national sample of the US population (N\,=\,1000), we elicited top-of-mind associations with the term `fake news'. Consistent with our hypothesis, we find evidence that both liberals and conservatives freely associate traditionally left-wing (e.g. CNN) and right-wing (e.g. Fox News) media sources with the term fake news. Moreover, conservatives are especially likely to associate the mainstream media with the term fake news and these perceptions are generally linked to lower trust in media, voting for Trump, and higher belief in conspiracy theories.},

Factor analysis with one wave of data can then not distinguish between factor models with a single factor versus those with two factors that are causally related. Therefore, unless causal relations between factors can be ruled out a priori, alleged empirical evidence from one-wave factor analysis for a single factor effectively provides no information on the actual dimensionality of the true underlying factor structure. The implications for interpreting the factor structure of psychological scales, such as self-report scales for anxiety and depression, are discussed. Some further generalizations to an arbitrary number of underlying factors are noted.},

The current paper introduces the concept of approximate MI building on the work of Muth\'en and Asparouhov and their application of Bayesian Structural Equation Modeling (BSEM) in the software Mplus. They showed that with BSEM exact zeros constraints can be replaced with approximate zeros to allow for minimal steps away from strict MI, still yielding a well-fitting model. This new opportunity enables researchers to make explicit trade-offs between the degree of MI on the one hand, and the degree of model fit on the other. Throughout the paper we discuss the topic of approximate MI, followed by an empirical illustration where the test for MI fails, but where allowing for approximate MI results in a well-fitting model. Using simulated data, we investigate in which situations approximate MI can be applied and when it leads to unbiased results. Both our empirical illustration and the simulation study show approximate MI outperforms full or partial MI In detecting/recovering the true latent mean difference when there are (many) small differences in the intercepts and factor loadings across groups. In the discussion we provide a step-by-step guide in which situation what type of MI is preferred. Our paper provides a first step in the new research area of (partial) approximate MI and shows that it can be a good alternative when strict MI leads to a badly fitting model and when partial MI cannot be applied.},

Despite rapid progress in the field, questions of adequate measurement and empirical evaluation of measures of populist attitudes remain scarce. Seeking to remedy these shortcomings, we apply a cross-national measurement model, using item response theory, to six established and two new populist indicators. Drawing on a cross-national survey (nine European countries, n\,=\,18,368), we engage in a four-folded analysis. First, we examine the commonly used 6-item populism scale. Second, we expand the measurement with two novel items. Third, we use the improved 8-item populism scale to further refine equally comprehensive but more concise and parsimonious populist measurements. Finally, we externally validate these sub-scales and find that some of the proposed sub-scales outperform the initial 6- and 8-item scales. We conclude that existing measures of populism capture moderate populist attitudes, but face difficulties measuring more extreme levels, while the individual information of some of the populist items remains limited. Altogether, this provides several interesting routes for future research, both within and between countries.},

As SEM expands to ever larger, more complex applications, the estimation challenge grows and currently available methods will be insufficient. To overcome this challenge in SEM, we see an opportunity to use existing solutions from the field of deep learning, which has been pioneering methods for estimation of complex models for decades. To this end, this paper introduces computation graphs, a flexible method of specifying objective functions. When combined with state-of-the-art optimizers, we argue that our computation graph approach is capable not only of estimating SEM models, but also of rapidly extending them -- without the need of bespoke software development for each new extension. We show that several SEM improvements follow naturally from our approach; not only existing extensions such as least absolute deviation estimation and penalized regression models, but also novel extensions such as spike-and-slab penalties for sparse factor analysis. By applying computation graphs to SEM, we hope to greatly accelerate the process of developing SEM techniques, paving the way for novel applications. The accompanying R package tensorsem is under active development.},

The DS-R was administered to students from the University of Groningen (N=472) and Ghent University (N=41) to study its psychometric properties. The revisions improved the psychometric features of the DS, and showed that the DS-R is a valid and reliable index to establish core disgust, animal-reminder disgust, and contamination.},

The opinion updates based on the signal from a random neighbor or from an external entity who attempts to manipulate or control the network. In the absence of the external signal or a constant signal, this model is shown to asymptotically produce consensus with a finite number of connected agents. Additionally, the consensus is determined by the signal. On the other hand, when the number of agents is large, the time to achieve consensus can become exponentially large and the dynamics exhibit population equilibrium points that are ''metastable''. These equilibria can be observed with a finite (but large) number of agents through numerical simulations and are shown to persist for a long duration.},

  abstract = {Many guidelines have been developed for simulations in general or for agent-based models which support artificial societies. When applying such guidelines to examine existing practices, assessment studies are limited by the artifacts released by modelers. Although code is the final product defining an artificial society, 90\% of the code produced is not released hence previous assessments necessarily focused on higher-level items such as conceptual design or validation. We address this gap by collecting 338 artificial societies from two hosting platforms, CoMSES/OpenABM and GitHub. An innovation of our approach is the use of software engineering techniques to automatically examine the models with respect to items such as commenting the code, using libraries, or dividing code into functions. We found that developers of artificial societies code the decision-making of their agents from scratch in every model, despite the existence of several libraries that could be used as building blocks.},

  abstract = {Agent-based modeling (ABM) is a powerful paradigm to gain insight into social phenomena. One area that ABM has rarely been applied is coalition formation. Traditionally, coalition formation is modeled using cooperative game theory. In this paper, a heuristic algorithm is developed that can be embedded into an ABM to allow the agents to find coalition. The resultant coalition structures are comparable to those found by cooperative game theory solution approaches, specifically, the core. A heuristic approach is required due to the computational complexity of finding a cooperative game theory solution which limits its application to about only a score of agents. The ABM paradigm provides a platform in which simple rules and interactions between agents can produce a macro-level effect without the large computational requirements. As such, it can be an effective means for approximating cooperative game solutions for large numbers of agents. Our heuristic algorithm combines agent-based modeling and cooperative game theory to help find agent partitions that are members of a games' core solution. The accuracy of our heuristic algorithm can be determined by comparing its outcomes to the actual core solutions. This comparison achieved by developing an experiment that uses a specific example of a cooperative game called the glove game. The glove game is a type of exchange economy game. Finding the traditional cooperative game theory solutions is computationally intensive for large numbers of players because each possible partition must be compared to each possible coalition to determine the core set; hence our experiment only considers games of up to nine players. The results indicate that our heuristic approach achieves a core solution over 90\% of the time for the games considered in our experiment.},

While many studies have examined relationships between specific variables, little is known about the breadth of relationships between multiple climate and energy-relevant concepts. In this paper we used network models to explore and visualize relationships between climate change beliefs and energy preferences, using data from Round 8 of the European Social Survey (ESS8). ESS8 was conducted in 22 European countries and Israel. We found positive relationships between climate change salience, climate change beliefs, climate change concern, personal norm, and personal outcome expectancy, in line with prominent theories within the area. Moreover, beliefs on efficacy of actions of different actors (i.e., governments, large groups of people) to reduce climate change were positively related, and participants had consistent preferences for fossil energy sources or renewable energy sources, respectively. Furthermore, two types of energy security concerns could be distinguished, reflecting temporary and long term threats to energy security, respectively. Energy supply source preferences, energy policy support, and energy conservation behaviors were mostly not uniquely related to the other module variables. Furthermore, the relationships between variables, reflected in the network structure, were comparable across countries.},

Due to the difficulty of identifying significant laws needed to change the policy             status quo, evidence about governments' ability to change policy has been mostly provided             for a limited number of reforms and single-country studies. To evaluate the predictive             power of veto player theory for policy making across time, policy areas and countries,             a dataset was gathered that incorporates about 5,600 important government reform measures             in the areas of social, labour, economic and taxation policy undertaken in 13 Western             European countries from the mid-1980s until the mid-2000s. Veto player theory is applied             in a combined model with other central theoretical expectations on policy change derived             from political economy (crisis-driven policy change) and partisan theory (ideology-driven             policy change). Robust support is found that governments introduce more reform measures             when economic conditions are poor and when the government is positioned further away             from the policy status quo. No empirical support is found for predictions of veto             player theory in its pure form, where no differentiation between government types             is made. However, the findings provide support for the veto player theory in the special             case of minimal winning cabinets, where the support of all government parties is sufficient             (in contrast to minority cabinets) and necessary (in contrast to oversized cabinets)             for policy change. In particular, it is found that in minimal winning cabinets the             ideological distance between the extreme government parties significantly decreases             the government's ability to introduce reforms. These findings improve our understanding             of reform making in parliamentary democracies and highlight important issues and open             questions for future applications and tests of the veto player theory.          {$<$}/p{$>$}},

This work presents a comparative study of some representative state-of-the-art methods for overlapping community detection from the perspective of the structural properties of the communities identified by them. Experiments with synthetic and real-world benchmark Ground-Truth networks show that, although the methods are able to identify modular communities, they often miss many structural properties of the communities, such as the number of nodes in the overlapping region and the memberships of the nodes. This is a strong suggestion that a deeper comprehension of the overlapping properties of the communities is needed for the design of more efficient community detection methods.},

Here we introduce one possible strategy for reducing political prejudice: political inclusion. We define political inclusion as receiving a fair chance to voice one's opinions in a discussion of political topics with political outgroup members. This strategy may reduce political prejudice by inducing perceptions of the political outgroup as fair and respectful; however, such a strategy may also highlight conflicting attitudes and worldviews, thereby further exacerbating prejudice. In three preregistered studies (total N = 799), we test if political inclusion reduces or increases prejudice toward the political outgroup. Specifically, political inclusion was manipulated with either an imagined scenario (Study 1) or a concurrent experience in an ostensible online political discussion (Studies 2 \&amp; 3). Across all studies, participants who were politically included by political outgroup members reported reduced prejudice toward their outgroup compared to participants in a neutral control condition (Cohen's d [-0.27, -0.50]). This effect was mediated by perceptions of the political outgroup as fairer and less dissimilar in their worldviews. Our results indicate that political discussions that are politically inclusive do not cause additional prejudice via worldview conflict, but instead give others a feeling of being heard. It is a promising strategy to reduce political prejudice.},

If the degree sequence is constrained only on average, the corresponding grandcanonical ensemble of random graphs with a given expected degree sequence is the soft configuration model. If the degree sequence is not fixed at all but randomly drawn from a fixed distribution, the corresponding hypercanonical ensemble of random graphs with a given degree distribution is the hypersoft configuration model, a more adequate description of dynamic real-world networks in which degree sequences are never fixed but degree distributions often stay stable. Here, we introduce the hypersoft configuration model of weighted networks. The main contribution is a particular version of the model with power-law degree and strength distributions, and superlinear scaling of strengths with degrees, mimicking the properties of some real-world networks. As a by-product, we generalize the notions of sparse graphons and their entropy to weighted networks.},

We use different fluctuating signals and compare structural dissimilarities of the networks with those obtained with a constant growth signal. We show that networks with power-law degree distributions, which are obtained with time-varying growth signals, are correlated and clustered, while networks obtained with a constant growth signal are not. Indeed, the properties of the growth signal significantly determine the topology of the obtained networks and thus ought to be considered prominently in models of complex systems.},

However, no study has systematically tested if disgust sensitivity is associated with moral judgments of the purity domain specifically, more generally to moral judgments of the binding moral domains, or to moral judgments of all of the moral domains equally. Across 5 studies (total N = 1,104), we find consistent evidence for the notion that disgust sensitivity relates more strongly to moral condemnation of purity-based transgressions (meta-analytic r = .40) than to moral condemnation of transgressions of any of the other domains (range meta-analytic rs: .07-.27).

However, the implications of this finding are limited as we find that eliminating the weirdest items from disgust sensitivity measures does not affect the tendency for the association between disgust sensitivity and moral judgments to be especially pronounced for purity transgressions. Although weirdness of disgust sensitivity items is associated with the disgust sensitivity-purity link, it cannot explain why disgust sensitivity is more strongly related to moral judgments of purity transgressions.},

As a network of binary variables with the probability of becoming 'active' depending only on direct neighbours, the Ising model appears appropriate for many other processes. For instance, it was recently applied in psychology to model co-occurrences of mental disorders. It has been shown that the connections between the variables (nodes) in the Ising network can be estimated with a series of logistic regressions. This naturally leads to questions of how well such a model predicts new observations and how well parameters of the Ising model can be estimated using logistic regressions. Here we focus on the high-dimensional setting with more parameters than observations and consider violations of assumptions of the lasso. In particular, we determine the consequences for both prediction and estimation when the sparsity and restricted eigenvalue assumptions are not satisfied.

Various forms of coordination require communication among agents which may accidentally be distorted. This paper investigates how sensitive different coordination mechanisms, employed in distributed problem-solving systems, are to unintentional communication errors. For this, an agent-based simulation based on the framework of NK fitness landscapes is employed. The study controls for different levels of erroneous communication and complexity of the problems to be solved collaboratively. The results provide broad, though not universal support for detrimental effects of erroneous communication and suggest that the various coordination mechanisms under investigation show different sensitivity to communication errors. Moreover, the results indicate that the complexity of the overall problem to be solved and the objectives pursued by the agents considerably shape the robustness of coordination mechanisms against erroneous communication. The results shed some new light on the relation between communication and coordination and, in particular, may contribute to the organizational design of error tolerant systems.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Optimism about the Internet's potential to bring the world together has been tempered by concerns about its role in inflaming the 'culture wars'. Via mass selection into like-minded groups, online society may be becoming more fragmented and polarized, particularly with respect to partisan differences. However, our ability to measure the cultural makeup of online communities, and in turn understand the cultural structure of online platforms, is limited by the pseudonymous, unstructured, and large-scale nature of digital discussion. Here we develop a neural embedding methodology to quantify the positioning of online communities along cultural dimensions by leveraging large-scale patterns of aggregate behaviour. Applying our methodology to 4.8B Reddit comments made in 10K communities over 14 years, we find that the macro-scale community structure is organized along cultural lines, and that relationships between online cultural concepts are more complex than simply reflecting their offline analogues. Examining political content, we show Reddit underwent a significant polarization event around the 2016 U.S. presidential election, and remained highly polarized for years afterward. Contrary to conventional wisdom, however, instances of individual users becoming more polarized over time are rare; the majority of platform-level polarization is driven by the arrival of new and newly political users. Our methodology is broadly applicable to the study of online culture, and our findings have implications for the design of online platforms, understanding the cultural contexts of online content, and quantifying cultural shifts in online behaviour.},

  abstract = {In recent years, increasing interest has emerged in the behavioral, cognitive and social sciences towards methods drawn from dynamic systems analysis. This might be because of the recognition that many behavioral and neurophysiological processes are intrinsically time dependent and reliant on environmental and social context. One of the methods that has enjoyed a particular gain in interest is Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA). Particularly, advances towards a multivariate analysis of behavioral dynamics have been made thanks to this method, which comes in various types of analyses addressing different questions. These analyses are useful for assessing the strength of coupling/correlation between two or more time-series, particularly if these time-series are nonstationary or have complicated dynamics, such as in longer recordings of continuous physiological or movement data, but also in the case of time-series of symbolic data. What has been limiting the use of recurrence-based analyses though, is that none of the techniques are implemented in standard commercial statistical software packages (such as STATA, JMP, SPSS etc.). As far as libraries are available (e.g. in Matlab or R) many of them require a certain expertise in programming. In this paper, we aim at filling this gap, explaining multivariate recurrence-based analyses conceptually and practically, drawing on a variety of R-functions than implement these methods. Particularly, we will introduce Cross-Recurrence Quantification Analysis (CRQA), Diagonal Cross Recurrence Profiles (DCRP) and Multidimensional Recurrence Quantification Analysis (MdRQA), showing in a step-by-step process how the analyses are performed and summarizing the current best practice of their application.},

In order to apply the metric to recommender systems, we propose a way to make trust dynamic over time. We show by means of analytical approximations and computer simulations that the metric has the desired properties. Finally, we carry out an empirical validation on a dataset crawled from an Internet community and compare the performance of a recommender system using our metric to one using collaborative filtering.},

A full Bayesian approach with the Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm is developed for statistical inference. Simulation studies demonstrate the satisfactory performance of the developed methodology.

Following this line, we consider the self-excitation opinion model and study the collective behaviors of the self-excitation model.

This paper seeks to develop an understanding of the influences of individuals' baseline trust on the diffusion of trust and cooperation, in the presence of cheap talk over the Internet. We employ a novel approach, designing a virtual experiment that integrates abstract agent-based modeling and simulation with realistic, empirical network structures and baseline trust data from two large open source projects (Apache LUCENE and Google CHROMIUM OS). The results highlight the significant impact of baseline trust on the diffusion of trust and cooperation, for instance, the emergence of non-traditional diffusion trajectories. The results also demonstrate that proper seeding strategies can improve the effectiveness and efficiency of diffusion of trust and cooperation.},

However, current methods fail to reveal the full community structure and its formation process. Thus, here we present SIMGT, an effective and Scalable approach that detects overlapping communities: Integrating social identity Model and Game Theory. Inspired by social identity theory and nodes' high-order proximities, first we weight and rewire the original network, then we associate each node with a new utility function. Next, we model community formation as a non-cooperative game among all nodes, and we regard the nodes as self-interested players. Further, we use a stochastic gradient-ascent method to update players' strategies toward different communities, and prove that our game greatly resembles and matches how a potential game works (in the classical sense in game theory), indicating that the Nash equilibrium point must exist. Finally, we implement comprehensive experiments on several synthetic and real-life networks. The results show that whatever weighting strategy we choose, SIMGT can gain better performance on community detection task. In particular, SIMGT achieves a best result when we choose the Jaccard coefficient. After comparing SIMGT with six benchmark algorithms, we obtain convincing results in terms of how well the algorithms reveal communities, as well as algorithms' scalability.},

It is well-known that most algorithms proposed for fitting the stochastic block model likelihood function cannot scale to large-scale networks. One prominent work that overcomes this computational challenge is Amini et al.(2013), which proposed a fast pseudo-likelihood approach for fitting stochastic block models to large sparse networks. However, this approach does not have convergence guarantee, and is not well suited for small- or medium- scale networks. In this article, we propose a novel likelihood based approach that decouples row and column labels in the likelihood function, which enables a fast alternating maximization; the new method is computationally efficient, performs well for both small and large scale networks, and has provable convergence guarantee. We show that our method provides strongly consistent estimates of the communities in a stochastic block model. As demonstrated in simulation studies, the proposed method outperforms the pseudo-likelihood approach in terms of both estimation accuracy and computation efficiency, especially for large sparse networks. We further consider extensions of our proposed method to handle networks with degree heterogeneity and bipartite properties.},

Why is there such a simple law in many complex social systems is an interesting question. Although scientists from fields of statistical physics, complex systems, economics and transportation science have explained the social gravity law, a theoretical explanation including two dominant mechanisms, namely individual interaction and bounded rationality, is still lacking. Here we present a free utility model from the perspective of individual choice behavior to explain the social gravity law. The basic assumption is that bounded rational individuals interacting with each other will trade off the expected utility and information-processing cost to maximize their own utility. The previous explanations of the social gravity law including the maximum entropy model, the free cost model, the Logit model and the destination choice game model are all special cases under our model. Further, we extend the free utility model to the dummy network and real transportation network. This model not only helps us to better understand the underlying mechanisms of spatial interaction patterns in complex social systems, but also provides a new perspective for understanding the potential function in game theory and the user equilibrium model in transportation science.},

However, in the social network, link prediction may raise concerns about privacy and security, because, through link prediction algorithms, criminals can predict the friends of an account user and may even further discover private information such as the address and bank accounts. Therefore, it is urgent to develop a strategy to prevent being identified by link prediction algorithms and protect privacy, utilizing perturbation on network structure at a low cost, including changing and adding edges. This article mainly focuses on the influence of network structural preference perturbation through deletion on link prediction.

  abstract = {The adjustment of students to a school environment is fundamentally linked to the friendship networks they form with their peers. Consequently, the complete picture of a student's adjustment can only be obtained by taking into account both their friendship network and their reported perceptions of the school environment. However, there is a lack of flexible statistical models and methods that can jointly analyze a social network with an item-response data matrix. In this paper, we propose a latent space model for heterogeneous (multimodal) networks (LSMH) and its extension LSMH-Item, which combine the framework of latent space modeling in network analysis with item response theory in psychometrics. Using LSMH, we summarize the information from the social network and the item responses in a person-item joint latent space. We use a Variational Bayesian Expectation-Maximization estimation algorithm to estimate the item and person locations in the joint latent space. This methodology allows for effective integration, informative visualization, and prediction of social networks and item responses. We apply the proposed methodology to data collected from 16 third-grade classrooms comprised of 451 third-grade students' self-reported friendships and school liking, which were collected as part of the Early Learning Ohio project. Through the person-item joint latent space, we are able to identify students with potential adjustment difficulties and found consistent connection between students' friendship networks and their well-being. We believe that using LSMH, researchers will be able to easily identify students in need of intervention and revolutionize the understanding of social behaviors.},

Whereas there are several existing indices for assessing the ability of the model to reproduce network structure over time, to date there are few indices for assessing the ability of the model to reproduce individuals' behavior patterns. Drawing on the widely used strategy of assessing model adequacy by comparing index values summarizing features of the observed data to the distribution of those index values on simulated data from the fitted model, we propose four goals that a researcher could reasonably expect of a joint structure/behavior model regarding how well it captures behavior and describe indices for assessing each of these. These reasonably simple and easily implemented indices can be used for assessing model adequacy with any dynamic network models jointly working with networks and behavior, including the stochastic actor-based models implemented within software packages such as RSien version 1.2-24. We demonstrate the use of our indices with an empirical example to show how they can be employed in practical settings, with an additional extension to modeling affiliation dynamics in two-mode networks.

Overall, we find a great deal of stability in political orientation, with a slight tendency for the 2011 NetSense study participants to become more conservative during their first four semesters in college, but not the 2015 NetHealth study participants. Partisanship is the best predictor of changes in political orientation, with students who identify or vote as Republicans becoming more conservative over time. Neither network influence nor selection processes seem to be driving observed changes. During this formative period, relatively stable identities such as party affiliation predict changes in political orientation independently of local network dynamics, selection processes, socio-demographic traits, and dispositional factors.},

The existence of reputation could stimulate cooperation. In this work, individuals' reputation has been divided into being good, bad and medium according to their neighbors' judgement. Considering people with different requirements of reputation, we put forward a new reputation scoring mechanism with tolerance based on historical donations. First, we study the effect of different scoring rules on players' strategies. Based on this, we discuss the effect of neighbors' reputation on players' simulation process. In addition, we explore the population structure's influence on cooperation. Through numerical simulations, we are glad to find that the strict scoring rules could better stimulate cooperation in most circumstances.

  abstract = {Networks offer a powerful language with which to describe and study pairwise interaction. However, in many contexts, these rich collective phenomena require a higher-order approach to encode dynamical processes \textemdash{} for example in idea integration and information transmission (co-publication is a particularly familiar example). Here we introduce a novel framework for social communication by reshaping the networked system to be a simplicial complex, where the communication involves the interaction not only of individual nodes but also among cliques to which they belong. Simplicial complexes extend the network-based pairwise relationship to multiagent interaction. Assuming that the same individual in different cliques may play different roles, a threshold is designed and combined with the node state to determine the clique state. We employ the discrete microscopic Markov chain approach to model the simplex-based social communication and then obtain the underlying critical condition for information outbreaks. Moreover, we perform extensive numerical analysis of the proposed simplicial complex-based communication model and compare its performance with Monte Carlo simulation.},

In this multidisciplinary study, we consider the question of constructing traditional social networks from OSN data and then present a measurement case study showing how the reliability of OSN data affects social network analyses. To this end we developed a systematic comparison methodology, which we applied to two parallel datasets we collected from Twitter. We found considerable differences in datasets collected with different tools and that these variations significantly alter the results of subsequent analyses. Our results lead to a set of guidelines for researchers planning to collect online data streams to infer social networks.},

More specifically we focus on maximum entropy ensembles under constraints placed on the counts and distributions of atomic subgraphs and derive general expressions for the entropy of such models. We also present a procedure for combining distributions of multiple atomic subgraphs that enables the construction of models with fewer parameters. Expanding the model to include atoms with edge and vertex labels we obtain a general class of models that can be parametrized in terms of basic building blocks and their distributions that includes many widely used models as special cases. These models include random graphs with arbitrary distributions of subgraphs, random hypergraphs, bipartite models, stochastic block models, models of multilayer networks and their degree corrected and directed versions. We show that the entropy for all these models can be derived from a single expression that is characterized by the symmetry groups of atomic subgraphs.},

A sample of N = 969 participants provided data on the SDT and a range of further measures. Our competitive test of five structural models revealed that fit indices and nomological network assumptions were best met in a three-factor model, with separate factors for psychopathy, Machiavellianism, and narcissism. The results provided an extensive overview of the raw, unique, and shared associations of Dark Triad dimensions with narcissism facets, sadism, impulsivity, self-esteem, sensation seeking, the Big Five, maladaptive personality traits, sociosexual orientation, and behavioral criteria. Finally, the uSDT exhibited satisfactory psychometric properties. The highest overlap in expected relations between SDT and uSDT, and convergent and discriminant measures was also found for the three-factor model. Our study underlines the utility of a three-factor model of the Dark Triad, extends findings on its nomological network, and provides an ultrashort instrument.},

In this paper, we extend modularity belief propagation to multilayer networks. As part of this development, we also directly incorporate a resolution parameter. We show that adjusting the resolution parameter affects the convergence properties of the algorithm and yields different community structures than the baseline. We compare our approach with a widely used community detection tool, GenLouvain, across a range of synthetic, multilayer benchmark networks, demonstrating that our method performs comparably to the state of the art. Finally, we demonstrate the practical advantages of the additional information provided by our tool by way of two real-world network examples. We show how the convergence properties of the algorithm can be used in selecting the appropriate resolution and coupling parameters and how the node-level marginals provide an interpretation for the strength of attachment to the identified communities. We have released our tool as a Python package for convenient use.},

To better cope with the problem, this paper explores an evolutionary mechanism of the university Internet public opinion events. Firstly, we discuss the interactions and behavior of three key participants: an Internet medium, university students as a whole, and administration. Secondly, we construct a tripartite evolutionary game model consisting of an Internet medium, student group, and university administration and then analyze and obtain the differential dynamic equations and equilibrium points. Subsequently, the evolutionary stable equilibrium is further analyzed. Finally, we employ numerical studies to examine how the tripartite behavior choices affect evolutionary paths and evolutionary equilibrium strategies. Results are derived as follows: under certain conditions, there exists an asymptotically stable equilibrium point for the tripartite evolutionary game. On the one hand, appropriate penalties and rewards should be provided to foster objectives and fair behaviors of the network medium. On the other hand, university students should be educated and guided to deal rationally with negative effects of Internet public opinion events. Moreover, online real-name authentication is an important and necessary measure. Finally, the university administration should release truthful, timely, and comprehensive information of Internet public opinion events to mitigate potential negative impacts.},

Microscale structures are known to exist in most complex networks (e.g., large number of triangles or motifs), but they are absent in the simple random-graph models considered (e.g., as null models) in community-detection algorithms. In this paper we investigate the effect of microstructures on the appearance of communities in networks. We find that alone the presence of triangles leads to the appearance of communities even in methods designed to avoid the detection of communities in random networks. This shows that communities can emerge spontaneously from simple processes of motiff generation happening at a microlevel. Our results are based on four widely used community-detection approaches (stochastic block model, spectral method, modularity maximization, and the Infomap algorithm) and three different generative network models (triadic closure, generalized configuration model, and random graphs with triangles).},

In this perspective, expectations are updated (error minimization) only if sensory data sufficiently deviate from these expectations (prediction error). Although originally applied to perception, predictive processing is thought to generally characterize cognitive architecture, including the social cognitive processes involved in ideological thinking. Scaling up these simple computational principles to the social sphere outlines a path by which group members may adopt shared ideologies and beliefs to predict behavior and cooperate with each other. Because ideological judgments are of specific interest to others in our political groups, we may increasingly regulate each other's thinking, sharing the process of error minimization. In this paper, we outline how this process of shared error minimization may lead to shared ideologies and beliefs that allow group members to predict and cooperate with each other, and how, as a consequence, political polarization and extremism may result.},

  abstract = {The liberalization of attitudes toward homosexuality in the United States over the past 30 years is well documented. Despite these changes, substantial resistance to equality for gay men and lesbians remains. Previous studies indicate that beliefs about the etiology of homosexuality are central to this discussion. Those who believe homosexuality is innate are more favorable, while those who believe it is the result of a choice are more negative. Moreover, experimental research indicates that those with negative views actually become more opposed when a natural explanation is proposed. This study highlights the importance of perceived sources of epistemic and moral authority for understanding views of homosexuality. Using stances on culturally controversial issues involving ``science and religion'' as indicators of where individuals place authority, we outline the connection between perceptions of moral authority and attributions about homosexuality. Analyses of a national survey of American adults show that, net of controls, one's stance on moral authority is the strongest predictor of attributions about whether homosexuality is chosen or innate.},

  abstract = {Cultural evolutionary theories have proposed that prosocial religious traditions can facilitate societal complexity and large-scale cooperation among strangers, in part, through the culturally transmitted commitment to morally concerned supernatural entities. Although a growing number of studies have documented an association between reminders of religious concepts and increased prosocial behavior, fewer studies have directly examined mental models of supernaturally monitored morality. Study 1 used pre-existing closed-ended questionnaires to assess whether beliefs about karma reflect one's secular moral values. Studies 2 and 3 used an open-ended free-list task to investigate participants' mental models of which human behaviors are rewarded and punished by God and karma, among samples from the USA and India, including Hindu, Buddhist, Christian, and non-religious participants. We investigate how mental models of God and karma's moral concerns reflect (1) widespread consensus about the relevance of interpersonal cooperation, (2) one's own moral values and internalized cultural norms for moral behavior, and (3) target-specific differences between mental models of God and karma. Results demonstrate how supernatural beliefs reflect aspects of individuals' secular, interpersonal moral values, while also containing unique elements due to the particular relationships that believers have different supernatural entities.},

There are now alternative forms of regularization that were developed specifically to overcome issues inherent to the 1-penalty. To date, this information has not been synthesized. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of nonconvex regularization that spans from the smoothly clipped absolute deviation penalty to continuous approximations of the 0-penalty (i.e., best subset) for directly estimating the inverse covariance matrix. A common thread shared by these penalties is that they all enjoy the oracle properties, that is, they perform as though the true generating model were known in advance. To ensure their theoretical properties are general, I conducted extensive numerical experiments that indicated superior and more than competitive performance when compared to glasso and non-regularized model selection, respectively, all the while being computationally feasible for many variables. In addition, the important topics of tuning parameter selection and statistical inference in regularized models are reviewed. The penalties are employed to estimate the dependence structure of post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms. The discussion includes several ideas for future research, including a plethora of information to facilitate their study. I have implemented the methods in the R package GGMncv.},

  abstract = {Network psychometrics is undergoing a time of methodological reflection. In part, this was spurred by the revelation that 1-regularization does not reduce spurious associations in partial correlation networks. In this work, we address another motivation for the widespread use of regularized estimation: the thought that it is needed to mitigate overfitting. We first clarify important aspects of overfitting and the bias-variance tradeoff that are especially relevant for the network literature, where the number of nodes or items in a psychometric scale are not large compared to the number of observations (i.e., a low p/n ratio). This revealed that bias and especially variance are most problematic in p/n ratios rarely encountered. We then introduce a nonregularized method, based on classical hypothesis testing, that fulfills two desiderata: (1) reducing or controlling the false positives rate and (2) quelling concerns of overfitting by providing accurate predictions. These were the primary motivations for initially adopting the graphical lasso (glasso). In several simulation studies, our nonregularized method provided more than competitive predictive performance, and, in many cases, outperformed glasso. It appears to be nonregularized, as opposed to regularized estimation, that best satisfies these desiderata. We then provide insights into using our methodology. Here we discuss the multiple comparisons problem in relation to prediction: stringent alpha levels, resulting in a sparse network, can deteriorate predictive accuracy. We end by emphasizing key advantages of our approach that make it ideal for both inference and prediction in network analysis.},

To demonstrate the utility of our approach, we provide a case study that examines one team's interaction for a Lost at Sea simulation. Our results show that we are able to recover transitions in the task and in the team interaction. Not only this, but we uncover structural changes in the energy and engagement of team members and visualize these in networks.

The paper applies the method to data collected in the 2011 Swiss Electoral Study (SES), in which survey participation incentives were randomly assigned across members of the original survey sample. The empirical analysis shows that the incentives increased response rates substantially. Estimates of a new instrumental variable parameter called the Complier Average Survey Response (CASR) suggest that the incentives induced participation among people with more nationalist political opinions than those who would have participated without the incentives. Weighting the respondent data to match the covariate distribution in the target population did not account for the discrepancy in attitudes between the two groups, suggesting that the weights would not succeed in removing nonresponse bias.},

  abstract = {Societal transformations are necessary to address critical global challenges, such as mitigation of anthropogenic climate change and reaching UN sustainable development goals. Recently, social tipping processes have received increased attention, as they present a form of social change whereby a small change can shift a sensitive social system into a qualitatively different state due to strongly self-amplifying (mathematically positive) feedback mechanisms. Social tipping processes have been suggested as key drivers of sustainability transitions emerging in the fields of technological and energy systems, political mobilization, financial markets and sociocultural norms and behaviors. Drawing from expert elicitation and comprehensive literature review, we develop a framework to identify and characterize social tipping processes critical to facilitating rapid social transformations. We find that social tipping processes are distinguishable from those of already more widely studied climate and ecological tipping dynamics. In particular, we identify human agency, social-institutional network structures, different spatial and temporal scales and increased complexity as key distinctive features underlying social tipping processes. Building on these characteristics, we propose a formal definition for social tipping processes and filtering criteria for those processes that could be decisive for future trajectories to global sustainability in the Anthropocene. We illustrate this definition with the European political system as an example of potential social tipping processes, highlighting the potential role of the FridaysForFuture movement. Accordingly, this analytical framework for social tipping processes can be utilized to illuminate mechanisms for necessary transformative climate change mitigation policies and actions.},

  abstract = {In brain connectomics, the cortical surface is parcellated into different regions of interest (ROIs) prior to statistical analysis. The brain connectome for each individual can then be represented as a graph, with the nodes corresponding to ROIs and edges to connections between ROIs. Such a graph can be summarized as an adjacency matrix, with each cell containing the strength of connection between a pair of ROIs. These matrices are symmetric with the diagonal elements corresponding to self-connections typically excluded. A major disadvantage of such representations of the connectome is their sensitivity to the chosen ROIs, including critically the number of ROIs and hence the scale of the graph. As the scale becomes finer and more ROIs are used, graphs become increasingly sparse. Clearly, the results of downstream statistical analyses can be highly dependent on the chosen parcellation. To solve this problem, we propose a multi-scale graph factorization, which links together scale-specific factorizations through a common set of individual-specific scores. These scores summarize an individual's brain structure combining information across measurement scales. We obtain a simple and efficient algorithm for implementation, and illustrate substantial advantages over single scale approaches in simulations and analyses of the Human Connectome Project dataset.},

Numerical results show that: (1) the closure of a single city in general will affect the tourist visitations of many other cities in the network and, comparing to the non-port cities, the overall visitation volume of the system is more influenced by closing a port city; (2) the opening of a new port city in western China will attract more tourists to the western cities, but has a negligible impact on either the overall visitation volume or the imbalanced tourist distribution; and (3) the increase of the tourism attractiveness of a non-port (port) city normally increases (decreases) the overall visitation volume, yet there are exceptions due to the spillover effect. Furthermore, by increasing the tourism attractiveness of a few cities simultaneously, we investigate also the strategy of multiple-city-upgrade in tourism development. Numerical results show that the overall tourist volume is better improved by upgrading important non-port cities that are geographically distant from each other. The study reveals the rich dynamics inherent in complex tourism network, and the findings could be helpful to the development and management of China inbound tourism. {$<$}/p{$>$}},

Here, we show first how the edge set of a multiplex network can be used to construct an estimator of a joint probability distribution describing edge existence over all layers. We then adapt an information-theoretic measure of general correlation called the conditional mutual information, which uses the estimated joint probability distribution, to quantify the pairwise correlations present between layers. The pairwise comparisons can also be temporal, allowing us to identify if knowledge of a certain layer can provide additional information about the evolution of another layer. We analyse datasets from three distinct domains\textemdash economic, political, and airline networks\textemdash to demonstrate how pairwise correlation in structure and dynamical evolution between layers can be identified and show that anomalies can serve as potential indicators of major events such as shocks.},

In this work we develop a distributed spectral clustering algorithm for community detection in large scale networks. To handle the problem, we distribute l pilot network nodes on the master server and the others on worker servers. A spectral clustering algorithm is first conducted on the master to select pseudo centers. The indexes of the pseudo centers are then broadcasted to workers to complete distributed community detection task using a SVD type algorithm. The proposed distributed algorithm has three merits. First, the communication cost is low since only the indexes of pseudo centers are communicated. Second, no further iteration algorithm is needed on workers and hence it does not suffer from problems as initialization and non-robustness. Third, both the computational complexity and the storage requirements are much lower compared to using the whole adjacency matrix. A Python package DCD (www.github.com/Ikerlz/dcd) is developed to implement the distributed algorithm for a Spark system. Theoretical properties are provided with respect to the estimation accuracy and mis-clustering rates. Lastly, the advantages of the proposed methodology are illustrated by experiments on a variety of synthetic and empirical datasets.},

Since these opinion percentages can be seen as an aggregated observation of the full system state, the individual opinions of each agent, we view this in the framework of the Mori-Zwanzig projection formalism. More specifically, we show how to estimate a nonlinear autoregressive model (NAR) with memory from data given by a time series of opinion percentages, and discuss its prediction capacities for various specific topologies of the agent interaction network. We demonstrate that the inclusion of memory terms significantly improves the prediction quality on examples with different network topologies.},

Yet, recent studies have argued that Western citizens are turning their backs on the system of self-governance, thereby eroding the societal foundations of consolidated democracies. This study contributes to discussions about citizen support of democracy by (1) analyzing new cross-national survey data in 18 European countries that facilitate assessments of the temporal and geographical generalizability of previous findings, (2) disentangling age, cohort and period effects, thereby aligning the analytical methods with the theoretical arguments and (3) transparently reporting all evidence derived from pre-registered analyses to avoid cherry-picked findings. The findings show that citizens of consolidated democracies continue to endorse self-governance. Yet in some (but not all) countries, there is evidence of a growing number of `democrats in name only', particularly among the young generation. These findings suggest a second phase in research on democratic fatigue that broadens the analytical scope for the multi-faceted nature of democratic support.},

  abstract = {Network models are gaining popularity as a way to estimate direct effects among psychological variables and investigate the structure of constructs. A key feature of network estimation is determining which edges are likely to be non-zero. In psychology, this is commonly achieved through the graphical lasso regularization method that estimates a precision matrix of Gaussian variables using an {$\mathscr{l}$}1-penalty to push small values to zero. A tuning parameter, {$\lambda$}, controls the sparsity of the network. There are many methods to select {$\lambda$}, which can lead to vastly different graphs. The most common approach in psychological network applications is to minimize the extended Bayesian information criterion, but the consistency of this method for model selection has primarily been examined in high dimensional settings (i.e., n {$<$} p) that are uncommon in psychology. Further, there is some evidence that alternative selection methods may have superior performance. Here, using simulation, we compare four different methods for selecting {$\lambda$}, including the stability approach to regularization selection (StARS), K-fold cross-validation, the rotation information criterion (RIC), and the extended Bayesian information criterion (EBIC). Our results demonstrate that penalty parameter selection should be made based on data characteristics and the inferential goal (e.g., to increase sensitivity versus to avoid false positives). We end with recommendations for selecting the penalty parameter when using the graphical lasso.},

However, in online social networks the low cost of link formation can lead to networks with heterogeneous relationship strengths (e.g., acquaintances and best friends mixed together). In this case, the binary friendship indicator provides only a coarse representation of relationship information. In this work, we develop an unsupervised model to estimate relationship strength from interaction activity (e.g., communication, tagging) and user similarity. More specifically, we formulate a link-based latent variable model, along with a coordinate ascent optimization procedure for the inference. We evaluate our approach on real-world data from Facebook and LinkedIn, showing that the estimated link weights result in higher autocorrelation and lead to improved classification accuracy.},

In the classification-based consensus framework, a maximum consensus-based optimization model is devised to determine the weight of decision makers by linearly combining three reliable sources: in-degree centrality, consistency and similarity indexes. This is done by maximizing the consensus level among decision makers regarding the collective classification of alternatives. Following this, a minimum information loss-based optimization model is constructed to generate the consensual collective classification of alternatives. It seeks to minimize the information loss between the additive preference relations provided by decision makers and their preference vectors. Particularly, the proposed optimization models are converted into 0-1 mixed linear programming models to easily find their optimal solutions. Finally, a numerical example and a detailed comparison analysis are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

Ideology-detection has long been a challenging yet important problem. Certain groups, such as the policy makers, rely on it to make wise decisions. Back in the old days when labor-intensive survey-studies were needed to collect public opinions, analyzing ordinary citizens' political tendencies was uneasy. The rise of social medias, such as Twitter, has enabled us to gather ordinary citizen's data easily. However, the incompleteness of the labels and the features in social network datasets is tricky, not to mention the enormous data size and the heterogeneousity. The data differ dramatically from many commonly-used datasets, thus brings unique challenges. In our work, first we built our own datasets from Twitter. Next, we proposed TIMME, a multi-task multi-relational embedding model, that works efficiently on sparsely-labeled heterogeneous real-world dataset. It could also handle the incompleteness of the input features. Experimental results showed that TIMME is overall better than the state-of-the-art models for ideology detection on Twitter. Our findings include: links can lead to good classification outcomes without text; conservative voice is under-represented on Twitter; follow is the most important relation to predict ideology; retweet and mention enhance a higher chance of like, etc. Last but not least, TIMME could be extended to other datasets and tasks in theory.},

The associated edge weights determine the corresponding level of influence from each parental node. In the simplest setup, the Bernoulli parameter of a particular node's state variable is a convex combination of the parental node states in the previous time instant and an additional Bernoulli noise random variable. This paper focuses on the problem of edge weight identification using Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimation and proves that the ML estimator is strongly consistent for two variants of the BAR model.

Most related works assume explicitly or implicitly that the interpersonal influence weights are always non-negative. In sharp comparison, we argue that such influence weights can be both positive and negative since there exist various contrasting relationships in real-world social networks. Hence, this article studies the evolution of opinion dynamics and social power on cooperative-competitive networks whose influence structure changes via a reflected appraisal mechanism along a sequence of issue discussions. Of particular focus is on identifying the pathways and effects of social power on shaping public opinions from a graph-theoretic perspective. Then, we propose a dynamic model for the reflected self-appraisal process, which enables us to discuss how the individual social power evolves over sequential issue discussions. By accommodating differential Lyapunov theory, we show the global exponential convergence of the self-appraisal model for almost all network topologies. Finally, we conclude that the self-appraisals and social powers are eventually dependent only on an interpersonal appraisal profile.},

First, most studies have investigated the issue in oversimplified networks in which several important network characteristics are ignored. Second, the opinions of individuals are modeled as bipartite states(e.g., support or not) in numerous studies, however, this setting is too strict for many real scenarios. In this study, we focus on social trust networks(STNs), which have the significant characteristics ignored in the previous studies. We generalized a famed continuous-valued opinion dynamics model for STNs, which is more consistent with real scenarios. We subsequently formalized two novel problems for solving the issue in STNs.

These issues in network observations could bias the estimation of common network models (such as those pertaining to influence and selection) and lead to erroneous statistical inferences. In this study, we proposed a simulation-based sensitivity analysis method that can evaluate the robustness of inferences made in social network analysis to six forms of selection mechanisms that can cause biases in network observations\textemdash random, homophily, anti-homophily, transitivity, reciprocity, and preferential attachment. We then applied this sensitivity analysis to test the robustness of inferences for social influence effects, and we derived two sets of analytical solutions that can account for biases in network observations due to random, homophily, and anti-homophily selection.},

The epidemic threshold is given. Randomness is one of the striking characteristics of real-world networks as they evolve. Based on the specific stochastic block model (SBM) to generate synthetic networks with community structure, we use nonnegative matrix theory to analyze the changes in the spread of epidemics during the growth, contraction, division or merger of communities. A reduction in the number of communities, a reduction in the size of communities or a division of communities is conductive to increasing epidemic threshold, and thus mitigating the spread of epidemics. Our conclusion can explain some phenomena. The numerical simulations of real-world and random networks support and enrich our conclusions.},

Among a variety of approaches for detecting communities, the label propagation algorithm (LPA) is the simplest and time-efficient approach. However, the original label propagation algorithm is not stable due to the randomness in its propagation process. In this paper, we propose a graph-based label propagation algorithm (GLPA) to detect communities incorporating the node similarity and connectivity information during the propagation of the labels. First, we define node similarity between adjacent nodes, and change each node's label to that of its most similar neighbor node. Based on the label propagation process, GLPA constructs a label propagation graph to get candidate communities. Then, GLPA calculates the connected components of the label propagation graph. Each connected component is treated as a candidate community in the next step. Second, GLPA constructs a weighted graph to obtain final communities, in which each connected component are treated as a super-node, and the number of edges lying between the corresponding components as the weight of edges. We compute the merging factor for each node in the weighted graph and merge super nodes with higher merging factor to its most similar node iteratively to reach the maximum complementary entropy. Compared with 8 other classical community detection algorithms on LFR artificial networks and 12 real world networks, the proposed algorithm GLPA shows preferable performance on stability, NMI, ARI, modularity.},

  abstract = {The problem of estimating high-dimensional Gaussian graphical models has gained much attention in recent years. Most existing methods can be considered as one-step approaches, being either regression-based or likelihood-based. In this paper, we propose a two-step method for estimating the high-dimensional Gaussian graphical model. Specifically, the first step serves as a screening step, in which many entries of the concentration matrix are identified as zeros and thus removed from further consideration. Then in the second step, we focus on the remaining entries of the concentration matrix and perform selection and estimation for nonzero entries of the concentration matrix. Since the dimension of the parameter space is effectively reduced by the screening step, the estimation accuracy of the estimated concentration matrix can be potentially improved. We show that the proposed method enjoys desirable asymptotic properties. Numerical comparisons of the proposed method with several existing methods indicate that the proposed method works well. We also apply the proposed method to a breast cancer microarray data set and obtain some biologically meaningful results.},

  abstract = {Over the recent four decades, agent-based modeling and maximum entropy modeling have provided some of the most notable contributions applying concepts from complexity science to a broad range of problems in economics. In this paper, we argue that these two seemingly unrelated approaches can actually complement each other, providing a powerful conceptual/empirical tool for the analysis of complex economic problems. The maximum entropy approach is particularly well suited for an analytically rigorous study of the qualitative properties of systems in quasi-equilibrium. Agent-based modeling, unconstrained by either equilibrium or analytical tractability considerations, can provide a richer picture of the system under study by allowing for a wider choice of behavioral assumptions. In order to demonstrate the complementarity of these approaches, we use here two simple economic models based on maximum entropy principles \textendash a quantal response social interaction model and a market feedback model \textendash, for which we develop agent-based equivalent models. On the one hand, this allows us to highlight the potential of maximum entropy models for guiding the development of well-grounded, firstapproximation agent-based models. On the other hand, we are also able to demonstrate the capabilities of agent-based models for tracking irreversible and out-of-equilibrium dynamics as well as for exploring the consequences of agent heterogeneity, thus fundamentally improving on the original maximum entropy model and potentially guiding its further extension.},

Our approach tackles the challenge of incorporating bounded rationality into mathematical models and integrates the empirical finding of satisficing decision making---voters settle for candidates who are "good enough" when deciding for whom to vote. We test the model using data from the U.S. Congress over the past 150 years, and find that our predictions are consistent with the two major political parties' historical trajectory. In particular, the model explains how polarization between the Democrats and Republicans since the 1960s could be a consequence of increasing ideological homogeneity within the parties.},

We identify five core areas ripe for potentially transformative investment, including (1) machine-readable standards, (2) data access platforms, (3) search and discoverability, (4) claim validation, and (5) insight generation. In each case, we review limitations associated with current practices, identify concrete opportunities for improvement via automation, and discuss near-term barriers to progress.

Many reputation mechanisms have been proposed and tested over time. However, the main drawback of reputation management is that users need to share private information to gain trust in a system such as phone numbers, reviews, and ratings. Recently, a novel model that tries to overcome this issue was presented: the Dynamic Interaction-based Reputation Model (DIBRM). This approach to trust considers only implicit information automatically deduced from the interactions of users within an online community. In this primary research study, the Reddit and MathOverflow online social communities have been selected for testing DIBRM. Results show how this novel approach to trust can mimic behaviors of the selected reputation systems, namely Reddit and MathOverflow, only with temporal information.},

Due to the cross-reference of questions and answers (note that users also reference URLs external to the Q\&A site. In this paper, URL sharing refers to internal URLs within the Q\&A site, unless otherwise stated), knowledge is diffused in the Q\&A site, forming a large knowledge network. In Stack Overflow, why do developers share URLs? How is the community feedback to the knowledge being shared? What are the unique topological and semantic properties of the resulting knowledge network in Stack Overflow? Has this knowledge network become stable? If so, how does it reach to stability? Answering these questions can help the software engineering community better understand the knowledge diffusion process in programming-specific Q\&A sites like Stack Overflow, thereby enabling more effective knowledge sharing, knowledge use, and knowledge representation and search in the community. Previous work has focused on analyzing user activities in Q\&A sites or mining the textual content of these sites. In this article, we present a methodology to analyze URL sharing activities in Stack Overflow. We use open coding method to analyze why users share URLs in Stack Overflow, and develop a set of quantitative analysis methods to study the structural and dynamic properties of the emergent knowledge network in Stack Overflow. We also identify system designs, community norms, and social behavior theories that help explain our empirical findings. Through this study, we obtain an in-depth understanding of the knowledge diffusion process in Stack Overflow and expose the implications of URL sharing behavior for Q\&A site design, developers who use crowdsourced knowledge in Stack Overflow, and future research on knowledge representation and search.},

On the other hand, Bayesian approaches typically compute the posterior probability of the null hypothesis to evaluate its plausibility. We revisit Lindley's paradox (Lindley, 1957) and demystify the conflicting results between Bayesian and frequentist hypothesis testing procedures by casting a two-sided hypothesis as a combination of two one-sided hypotheses along the opposite directions. This can naturally circumvent the ambiguities of assigning a point mass to the null and choices of using local or non-local prior distributions. As p-value solely depends on the observed data without incorporating any prior information, we consider non-informative prior distributions for fair comparisons with p-value. The equivalence of p-value and the Bayesian posterior probability of the null hypothesis can be established to reconcile Lindley's paradox. Extensive simulation studies are conducted with multivariate normal data and random effects models to examine the relationship between the p-value and posterior probability.},

  abstract = {Community detection in complex networks is a difficult problem. Up to now, there is no very effective method to solve it. Recently, many community detection algorithms based on edge removal have been proposed. However, these edge removal methods often delete many key connections within communities and weaken (or destroy) the community structure of the network. This will make the network communities more difficult to be identified and reduce the accuracy and stability of the algorithm. This paper proposed a boundary connection deletion based community detection algorithm. Different from other algorithms, our algorithm focuses on identifying and removing the boundary connections between network modules. This can enhance the network community structure and get high quality network modules. With high performance, our algorithm can detect the optimal and hierarchical community structure in weighted networks simultaneously. In order to verify the effectiveness of our algorithm, the stability and robustness of our algorithm were firstly analyzed. Then a series of experiments had been done on the real-world and synthetic networks. The real-world networks include Zachary's karate club network, dolphin social network, American college foot-ball network, PolBooks network, Les Mis\'erables character network, and the coauthorship network of scientists; The synthetic networks include GN benchmark and LFR benckmark. Two indices NMI and ModularityQ were used to compare our algorithm with the recently proposed algorithms, including meta-LPAm+, Srinivas and Rajendran's model, IDPM, CFCDs, EDCD, CNM, and CDASS. Experimental results show that our algorithm has better performance than these algorithms.},

Using social network analysis, we found that the crew members' friend group connectedness significantly correlated with their positive and negative gossip network involvement. Higher connectedness amongst friends was associated with less involvement in spreading negative gossip and/or being a target of negative gossip. More central connectedness to the friend group was associated with more involvement in spreading positive gossip and/or being a target of positive gossip. These results suggest that the spread of both positive and negative gossip may influence and be influenced by friendship connections in a social network.},

One of the significant properties of social networks is the communication intensity between the users, which has not received much attention so far. Most of the proposed methods for detecting community structure in social networks have only considered communications between users. In this paper, using MinHash and label propagation, an algorithm called weighted label propagation algorithm (WLPA) has been proposed to detect community structure in signed and unsigned social networks. WLPA takes into account the intensity of communications in addition to the communications. In WLPA, first, the similarity of all adjacent nodes is estimated by using MinHash. Then, each edge is assigned a weight equal to the estimated similarity of its end nodes. The weights assigned to the edges somehow indicate the intensity of communication between users. Finally, the community structure of the network is determined through the weighted label propagation. Experiments on the benchmark networks indicate that WLPA is efficient and effective for detecting community structure in both signed and unsigned social networks.},

Understanding the relationship between different aspects of well-being is crucial for effective interventions of the well-being of adolescents.

The dataset comes from a representative sample of Chinese adolescents (17, 854 participants from rural and urban areas from Southern, Northern, and the middle part of China)., Results: The 20 items of EPOCH formed a highly interconnected network. The item H4 (``I am a cheerful person.''), item E2 (``I get completely absorbed in what I am doing''), and item O4 (``I believe that things will work out, no matter how diffcult they seem'') were the traits with the highest centrality in the network., Conclusions: Cheerfulness, engagement in current activity, and optimism for the future are most central to the psychological well-being of Chinese adolescents. Future studies should further test the dynamics between these central traits and other well-being traits to find effective interventions of well-being of adolescents.},

  abstract = {Over the last decades, large international datasets such as the European Social Survey (ESS), the European Value Study (EVS) and the World Value Survey (WVS) have been collected to compare value means over multiple time points and across many countries. Yet analyzing comparative survey data requires the fulfillment of specific assumptions, i.e., that these values are comparable over time and across countries. Given the large number of groups that can be compared in repeated cross-national datasets, establishing measurement invariance has been, however, considered unrealistic. Indeed, studies which did assess it often failed to establish higher levels of invariance such as scalar invariance. In this paper we first introduce the newly developed approximate approach based on Bayesian structural equation modeling (BSEM) to assess cross-group invariance over countries and time points and contrast the findings with the results from the traditional exact measurement invariance test. BSEM examines whether measurement parameters are approximately (rather than exactly) invariant. We apply BSEM to a subset of items measuring the universalism value from the Portrait Values Questionnaire (PVQ) in the ESS. The invariance of this value is tested simultaneously across 15 ESS countries over six ESS rounds with 173,071 respondents and 90 groups in total. Whereas, the use of the traditional approach only legitimates the comparison of latent means of 37 groups, the Bayesian procedure allows the latent mean comparison of 73 groups. Thus, our empirical application demonstrates for the first time the BSEM test procedure on a particularly large set of groups.},

  abstract = {The recent information explosion may have many negative impacts on college students, such as distraction from learning and addiction to meaningless and fake news. To avoid these phenomena, it is necessary to verify the students' state of mind and give them appropriate guidance. However, many peculiarities, including subject focused, multiaspect, and low consistency on different samples' interests, bring great challenges while leveraging the mainstream opinion mining method. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a new way by using a questionnaire which covers most aspects of a student's life to collect comprehensive information and feed the information into a neural network. With reliable prediction on students' state of mind and awareness of feature importance, colleges can give students guidance associated with their own experience and make macroscopic policies more effective. A pipeline is proposed to relieve overfitting during the collected information training. First, the singular value decomposition is used in pretreatment of data set which includes outlier detection and dimension reduction. Then, the genetic algorithm is introduced in the training process to find the proper initial parameters of network, and in this way, it can prevent the network from falling into the local minimum. A method of calculating the importance of students' features is also proposed. The experiment result shows that the new pipeline works well, and the predictor has high accuracy on predicting fresh samples. The design procedure and the prediction design will provide suggestions to deal with students' state of mind and the college's public opinion.},

To overcome the challenge in sampling the high-dimensional posterior, we introduce an auxiliary implicit sampling (AIS) algorithm using two-step observations. Numerical results show that the AIS algorithm leads to accurate predictions of the sizes and centers for the leading clusters, in both cases of noiseless and noisy observations. In particular, the centers are predicted with high success rates, but the sizes exhibit a considerable uncertainty that is sensitive to observation noise and the observation ratio.},

  abstract = {Latent variable models have been playing a central role in psychometrics and related fields. In many modern applications, the inference based on latent variable models involves one or several of the following features: (1) the presence of many latent variables, (2) the observed and latent variables being continuous, discrete, or a combination of both, (3) constraints on parameters, and (4) penalties on parameters to impose model parsimony. The estimation often involves maximizing an objective function based on a marginal likelihood/pseudo-likelihood, possibly with constraints and/or penalties on parameters. Solving this optimization problem is highly non-trivial, due to the complexities brought by the features mentioned above. Although several efficient algorithms have been proposed, there lacks a unified computational framework that takes all these features into account. In this paper, we fill the gap. Specifically, we provide a unified formulation for the optimization problem and then propose a quasi-Newton stochastic proximal algorithm. Theoretical properties of the proposed algorithms are established. The computational efficiency and robustness are shown by simulation studies under various settings for latent variable model estimation.},

Theoretical studies based on Nash equilibrium analysis predict that the punishment effect is often stronger than the reward effect. Although this result is confirmed by empirical studies, subjects do not always play these rational strategies. Recent experiments indicate that most subjects in PGGs are conditional cooperators who tend to contribute the group average. In this paper, we consider PGGs with three types of subjects, namely, cooperators, defectors, and conditional cooperators. Evolutionary game method is applied to investigate how conditional cooperators affect the effectiveness of different types of incentives. Overall, having conditional cooperators cannot lead to a higher contribution level in the standard PGG or the PGG with institutional rewards. However, they can enhance the effectiveness of institutional punishment, where a high contribution level can be maintained even for small punishments. As a consequence, in PGGs with conditional cooperators, punishment always leads to a higher contribution rate than do rewards. Numerical analysis indicates that this result is robust to errors in decision making.},

Extending existing deep generative models from static to dynamic graphs is a challenging task, which requires to handle the factorization of static and dynamic characteristics as well as mutual interactions among node and edge patterns. Here, this paper proposes a novel framework of factorized deep generative models to achieve interpretable dynamic graph generation. Various generative models are proposed to characterize conditional independence among node, edge, static, and dynamic factors. Then, variational optimization strategies as well as dynamic graph decoders are proposed based on newly designed factorized variational autoencoders and recurrent graph deconvolutions.

Results showed that the walking speed of pedestrians\textemdash the individuals and group members in a mixed crowd\textemdash basically decreased compared with their walking speed in none-group crowd, and the decreasing of pedestrians' walking speed became more obvious with the size of groups inside the mixed crowd. Basically, the decrease in the degree of walking speed was larger for female pedestrians than for the male pedestrians. However, in the mixed crowd conditions with the 3-pedestrian group, the walking speed of individuals with an initial location near the group might possibly be higher than that in the none-group crowd condition, which might be caused by the accelerating process for overtaking the group in front of them. This speed accelerating behavior was more remarkable among the male pedestrians in this study. In the mixed crowd conditions with the 4-pedestrian group, the overtaking of the group became more difficult for the individuals. The walking speed of a group in a crowd was lower than that in the free-walking environment because the group members had to pay more attention to maintain group relationships and not separate from each other in the crowd.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Whereas many theoretical studies have found that the heterogeneous learning ability effects cooperation rate, the individual learning ability in networks is still not well understood. It is known that an individual's learning ability is influenced not only by its first order neighbors, but also by higher order individuals, and even by the whole network. At present, existing methods to represent individual learning ability are based on degree centrality, resulting in ignoring the global centrality of nodes. In this paper, we design a method for describing the heterogeneous learning ability by taking advantage of a pre-factor \dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend x related to the node betweenness. And a parameter \dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend{} is used to tune \dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend x.

Transmission can represent information transfer across a social network, spread of a malicious virus across a computer network, or spread of an infectious disease across communities. The key insight is to assign proper weights to bottleneck edges of the graph based on their role in reducing the connection between two or more strongly-connected clusters within the graph. Selectively reducing the weights (implying reduced transmission rate) on the critical edges helps limit the transmission from one cluster to another. We refer to these as barrier weights and their computation is based on the eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian. Unlike other work on graph partitioning and clustering, we completely circumvent the associated computational complexities by assigning weights to edges instead of performing discrete graph cuts. This allows us to provide strong theoretical results on our proposed methods. We also develop approximations that allow low complexity distributed computation of the barrier weights using only neighborhood communication on the graph.},

An efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo procedure is described for the required computation of the posterior distribution for general vector parameters. Simulation studies and an application to a real survey data set are included to examine the finite sample performances of the methods proposed as well as the effect of different types of prior and different types of sampling design.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {The ranking of influential nodes in networks is of great significance. Influential nodes play an enormous role during the evolution process of information dissemination, viral marketing, and public opinion control. The sorting method of multiple attributes is an effective way to identify the influential nodes. However, these methods offer a limited improvement in algorithm performance because diversity between different attributes is not properly considered. On the basis of the k-shell method, we propose an improved multiattribute k-shell method by using the iterative information in the decomposition process. Our work combines sigmod function and iteration information to obtain the position index. The position attribute is obtained by combining the shell value and the location index. The local information of the node is adopted to obtain the neighbor property. Finally, the position attribute and neighbor attribute are weighted by the method of information entropy weighting. The experimental simulations in six real networks combined with the SIR model and other evaluation measure fully verify the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed method.},

More specifically, this work considers diversity to be the inclusion of users from multiple groups as opposed to homogeneous communities in which the majority of users are from one group. We design and propose the k{${_\ast}$}-Partite Clique (and the edge-maximum k{${_\ast}$}-Partite Clique Problem) which modifies the k-Partite Clique structure as a means to capture these large, diverse communities in a way that does not currently exist. We then design a non-trivial baseline enumeration algorithm, which is further improved via heuristics to significantly reduce the running time whilst avoiding excessive memory requirements. Moreover, we propose a core as well as a truss structure for the kPartite environment aimed at finding the edge-maximum k{${_\ast}$}Partite Clique structure on the network. Comprehensive experiments on real-world datasets verify both the effectiveness of the k{${_\ast}$}-Partite Clique at finding diverse communities as well as the efficiency of the proposed heuristics to our algorithms compared to reasonable baselines.},

To analyze such types of data, researchers have often followed a two-step approach by first constructing a composite measure and then using it in subsequent analysis. This paper presents a class of hierarchical item response models that help integrate measurement and analysis. In this approach, individual responses to multiple items stem from a latent preference, of which both the mean and variance may depend on observed covariates. Compared with the two-step approach, the hierarchical approach reduces bias, increases efficiency, and facilitates direct comparison across surveys covering different sets of items. Moreover, it enables us to investigate not only how preferences differ among groups, vary across regions, and evolve over time, but also levels, patterns, and trends of attitude polarization and ideological constraint. An open-source R package,~hIRT, is available for fitting the proposed models.},

  abstract = {Whether real-world complex networks are scale free or not has long been controversial. Recently, in Broido and Clauset [A. D. Broido, A. Clauset, Nat. Commun. 10, 1017 (2019)], it was claimed that the degree distributions of real-world networks are rarely power law under statistical tests. Here, we attempt to address this issue by defining a fundamental property possessed by each link, the degree\textendash degree distance, the distribution of which also shows signs of being power law by our empirical study. Surprisingly, although full-range statistical tests show that degree distributions are not often power law in real-world networks, we find that in more than half of the cases the degree\textendash degree distance distributions can still be described by power laws. To explain these findings, we introduce a bidirectional preferential selection model where the link configuration is a randomly weighted, two-way selection process. The model does not always produce solid power-law distributions but predicts that the degree\textendash degree distance distribution exhibits stronger power-law behavior than the degree distribution of a finite-size network, especially when the network is dense. We test the strength of our model and its predictive power by examining how real-world networks evolve into an overly dense stage and how the corresponding distributions change. We propose that being scale free is a property of a complex network that should be determined by its underlying mechanism (e.g., preferential attachment) rather than by apparent distribution statistics of finite size. We thus conclude that the degree\textendash degree distance distribution better represents the scale-free property of a complex network.},

  doi = {10.1017/pan.2018.53},
  abstract = {Political scientists are increasingly interested in causal mediation, and to this end, recent studies focus on estimating a quantity called the controlled direct effect (CDE). The CDE measures the strength of the causal relationship between a treatment and outcome when a mediator is fixed at a given value. To estimate the CDE, Joffe and Greene ({$<$}a href="\#r7"{$>$}2009{$<$}/a{$>$}) and Vansteelandt ({$<$}a href="\#r15"{$>$}2009{$<$}/a{$>$}) developed the method of sequential g-estimation, which was introduced to political science by Acharya, Blackwell, and Sen ({$<$}a href="\#r1"{$>$}2016{$<$}/a{$>$}). In this letter, we propose an alternative method called "regression-with-residuals" (RWR) for estimating the CDE. In special cases, we show that these two methods are algebraically equivalent. Yet, unlike sequential g-estimation, RWR can easily accommodate several types of effect moderation, including cases in which the effect of the mediator on the outcome is moderated by a posttreatment confounder. Although common in the social sciences, this type of effect moderation is typically assumed away in applications of sequential g-estimation, which may lead to bias if effect moderation is in fact present. We illustrate RWR by estimating the CDE of negative media framing on public support for immigration, controlling for respondent anxiety.},

  abstract = {While e-commerce industries envision drones as a promising solution to the challenges associated with last-mile logistics of product delivery, there is increasing public concern over the risks of these airborne innovations. A growing number of studies seek to gauge the public's risk beliefs about drone delivery and inform policy development before its widespread uptake. Complicating these efforts is the fact that beliefs are interconnected and embedded in a cognitive system. This article argues that public outcomes are not based on atomized and isolated beliefs about risks involving in drone delivery, but instead emerge from the patterns in the relationships among these expressed beliefs. However, little is known about the structural characteristics of risk belief systems related to drone delivery, and the implications for risk communication and management. In an effort to fill this void, we conducted a network analysis of risk beliefs about drone delivery based on nationally representative data (N = 1465). The results revealed structural connections among 11 risk beliefs and explored structural variations in the risk belief system between people with different attitudes toward drone delivery. The simulation results showed that risk-mitigating messages instigated greater changes to the public's risk perceptions when they targeted structurally central, as opposed to peripheral, risk beliefs. The reported evidence adds new insights into how risks about drone delivery are configured in the public consciousness, and provides guidance into how practitioners may mobilize structural leverage to optimize the effectiveness and efficiency of risk communication strategies.},

Hereby, we devise an advocacy for local group trust metrics, guiding us to the second part which presents Appleseed, our novel proposal for local group trust computation. Compelling in its simplicity, Appleseed borrows many ideas from spreading activation models in psychology and relates their concepts to trust evaluation in an intuitive fashion.

  abstract = {What are the socio-political consequences of infectious diseases? Humans have evolved to avoid disease and infection, resulting in a set of psychological mechanisms that promote disease-avoidance, referred to as the behavioural immune system (BIS). One manifestation of the BIS is the cautious avoidance of unfamiliar, foreign, or potentially contaminating stimuli. Specifically, when disease infection risk is salient or prevalent, authoritarian attitudes can emerge that seek to avoid and reject foreign outgroups while favoring homogenous, familiar ingroups. In the largest study conducted on the topic to date (N{$>$}240,000), elevated regional levels of infectious pathogens were related to more authoritarian attitudes on three geographical levels: across US metropolitan regions, US states, and cross-culturally across 47 countries. The link between pathogen prevalence and authoritarian psychological dispositions predicted conservative voting behavior in the 2016 US Presidential Election as well as more authoritarian governance and state laws, in which one group of people imposes asymmetrical laws on others in a hierarchical structure. Furthermore, cross-cultural analysis illustrated that the relationship between infectious diseases and authoritarianism was pronounced for infectious diseases that can be acquired from other humans (nonzoonotic), and does not generalize to other infectious diseases that can only be acquired from non-human species (zoonotic diseases). At a time of heightened awareness of infectious diseases, these findings are important reminders that public health and ecology can have ramifications for socio-political attitudes, and this can shape how citizens vote as well as how they govern and are governed.},

The advent of social media has led to even more challenges, given the higher speed of information propagation and the growing impact of social bots and anomalous accounts. Nevertheless, it is crucial to derive a trustworthy information diffusion graph, which is capable of highlighting the importance of specific nodes in spreading the original message. The paper introduces the interaction strength, a novel metric to model retweet cascade graphs by exploring users' interactions. Initial findings show the soundness of the approaches based on this new metric with respect to the state-of-the-art model, and its ability to generate a denser graph, revealing crucial nodes that participated in the retweet propagation. Reliable retweet graph generation will enable a better understanding of the diffusion path of a specific tweet.},
