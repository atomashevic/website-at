	title = {The network of narcissism},
	copyright = {All rights reserved},
	abstract = {The aim of this study is to explore the structural organization of narcissism facets obtained from Narcissism Personality Inventory (NPI), Pathological Narcissism Inventory (PNI), Grandiose Narcissism Scale (GNS) and Five-Factor Narcissism Inventory (FFNI). The sample included 423 participants (50\% females) from general population. Results of LASSO network analysis showed that exhibitionism (NPI) is the most central node, followed by the contingent self-esteem (PNI) and need for admiration (FFNI). Community network analysis showed that four communities could be detected: 1. exhibitionism, which also includes vanity and grandiose fantasies, 2. exploitativeness/entitlement, which also captures callousness, 3. authority/manipulativeness, and 4. vulnerable narcissism. The results revealed the complexity of grandiose narcissism, compared to vulnerable narcissism in applied set of instruments.},
