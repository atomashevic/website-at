  abstract = {Network models have become a valuable tool in making sense of a diverse range of social, biological, and information systems. These models marry graph and probability theory to visualize, understand, and interpret variables and their relations as nodes and edges in a graph. Many applications of network models rely on undirected graphs in which the absence of an edge between two nodes encodes conditional independence between the corresponding variables. To gauge the importance of nodes in such a network, various node centrality measures have become widely used, especially in psychology and neuroscience. It is intuitive to interpret nodes with high centrality measures as being important in a causal sense. Here, using the causal framework based on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), we show that the relation between causal influence and node centrality measures is not straightforward. In particular, the correlation between causal influence and several node centrality measures is weak, except for eigenvector centrality. Our results provide a cautionary tale: if the underlying real-world system can be modeled as a DAG, but researchers interpret nodes with high centrality as causally important, then this may result in sub-optimal interventions.},

  abstract = {"The scientific study of networks, including computer networks, social networks, and biological networks, has received an enormous amount of interest in the last few years. The rise of the Internet and the wide availability of inexpensive computers have made it possible to gather and analyze network data on a large scale, and the development of a variety of new theoretical tools has allowed us to extract new knowledge from many different kinds of networks. The study of networks is broadly interdisciplinary and important developments have occurred in many fields, including mathematics, physics, computer and information sciences, biology, and the social sciences. This book brings together for the first time the most important breakthroughs in each of these fields and presents them in a coherent fashion, highlighting the strong interconnections between work in different areas. Subjects covered include the measurement and structure of networks in many branches of science, methods for analyzing network data, including methods developed in physics, statistics, and sociology, the fundamentals of graph theory, computer algorithms, and spectral methods, mathematical models of networks, including random graph models and generative models, and theories of dynamical processes taking place on networks"--},

  abstract = {We propose a class of actor-oriented statistical models for closed social networks in general, and friendship networks in particular. The models are random utility models developed within a rational choice framework. Based on social psychological and sociological theories about friendship, mathematical functions capturing expected utility of individual actors with respect to friendship are constructed. Expected utility also contains a random (unexplained) component. We assume that, given their restrictions and contact opportunities, individuals evaluate their utility functions and behave such that they maximize the expected amount of utility. The behavior under consideration is the expression of like and dislike (choice of friends). Theoretical mechanisms that are modelled are, e.g., the principle of diminishing returns, the tendency towards reciprocated choices, and the preference for friendship relations with similar others. Constraints imposed on individuals are, e.g., the structure of the existing network, and the distribution of personal characteristics over the respondents. The models are illustrated by means of a data-set collected among university freshmen at 7 points in time during 1994 and 1995.},

  isbn = {978-3-319-22810-5},
  abstract = {Electoral outcomes in both established and new democracies alike generate a flurry of interest and analysis. However, the reasons to vote or not are varied. Herein lays a large part of the problem in trying to provide a single explanation for declining turnout for an entire country. In different places within a country different mixes of reasons may be at work. This geographic analysis of voter turnout focuses upon contemporary Italian democracy. Italy is a compelling case in which to examine the relationship between demography and democracy for several reasons. First, Italy is renowned for its historically high voter turnout rates. In the eighteen national elections since 1948, well over 80~\% of voters turned out in each and every political contest. Second, as alluded to previously, Italy has one of the highest proportions of citizens aged 65 and over in the world. Coupled with one of the world's lowest birthrates, it is projected that Italy will experience a significant population decline in the decades to come. Third, Italy is often considered to be divided into two distinct geographic regions: a prosperous, civic-minded and European-oriented north versus an underdeveloped, peripheral, stagnant and corrupt south. Sub-divisions of this twofold division are also very common, as we discuss later. Fourth, the economic crisis of 2008 ushered in a remarkable period of social, political and economic turmoil across the Eurozone, and resulted in several austerity measures, some of which have been particularly acute for Italy and many Italians. Finally, the 2013 general election marked low-points in terms of voter turnout, and more generally, public attitudes towards Italian politics and politicians. Recognizing how such factors influence political participation differently in different places across Italy will shed light on the age-turnout nexus, and highlight the value of incorporating spatial concepts and theories into demographic-based accounts of politics.},

Two models of cultural influence are developed, for settled and unsettled cultural periods. In settled periods, culture independently influences action, but only by providing resources from which people can construct diverse lines of action. In unsettled cultural periods, explicit ideologies directly govern action, but structural opportunities for action determine which among competing ideologies survive in the long run. This alternative view of culture offers new opportunities for systematic, differentiated arguments about culture's causal role in shaping action.]},

  abstract = {[Modernization theorists from Karl Marx to Daniel Bell have argued that economic development brings pervasive cultural changes. But others, from Max Weber to Samuel Huntington, have claimed that cultural values are an enduring and autonomous influence on society. We test the thesis that economic development is linked with systematic changes in basic values. Using data from the three waves of the World Values Surveys, which include 65 societies and 75 percent of the world's population, we find evidence of both massive cultural change and the persistence of distinctive cultural traditions. Economic development is associated with shifts away from absolute norms and values toward values that are increasingly rational, tolerant, trusting, and participatory. Cultural change, however, is path dependent. The broad cultural heritage of a society-Protestant, Roman Catholic, Orthodox, Confucian, or Communist-leaves an imprint on values that endures despite modernization. Moreover, the differences between the values held by members of different religions within given societies are much smaller than are cross-national differences. Once established, such cross-cultural differences become part of a national culture transmitted by educational institutions and mass media. We conclude with some proposed revisions of modernization theory.]},

We examine the extent to which protest attendance and petition signing have diffused to different kinds of actors across multiple generations; we test claims central to understanding trends in social movement participation. Using aggregated, cross-sectional survey data on political involvement from 34,241 respondents, we examine changes in the probability of ever having attended a protest or signed a petition over time periods and across cohorts using cross-classified, random-effects models. We find a strong generational effect on the probability of ever having attended a protest, which explains much of the observed change in self-reports of protest behavior. More than half of this generational effect is a result of compositional change, but we find little evidence that protest attendance diffused to new types of actors. We compare these findings with a less confrontational form of protesting, petition signing, which shows more period than cohort effects. We argue that social movement activities have not become a widespread means of civic engagement.},

OBJECTIVE To assess the assumptions made by the HAPC model, and the situations in which it does and does not work. METHODS Simulation study. Simulation scenarios assess the effect of (a) cohort trends in the Data Generating Process (DGP) (compared to only random variation), and (b) grouping cohorts (in both DGP and fitted model). RESULTS The model only works if either (a) we can assume that there are no linear (or non-linear) trends in periods or cohorts, (b) we control any cohort trend in the model\&\#x2019;s fixed part and assume there is no period trend, or (c) we group cohorts in such a way that they exactly match the groupings in the (unknown) DGP. Otherwise, the model can arbitrarily reapportion APC effects, radically impacting interpretation. CONCLUSIONS Since the purpose of APC analysis is often to ascertain the presence of period and/or cohort trends, and since we rarely have solid (if any) theory regarding cohort groupings, there are few circumstances in which this model achieves what Yang and Land claim it can. The results bring into question findings of several published studies using the HAPC model. However, the structure of the model remains a conceptual advance that is useful when we can assume the DGP has no period trends.]},

We propose here a measure of similarities between vertices based on random walks which has several important advantages: it captures well the community structure in a network, it can be computed efficiently, it works at various scales, and it can be used in an agglomerative algorithm to compute efficiently the community structure of a network. We propose such an algorithm which runs in time O(mn                        2) and space O(n                        2) in the worst case, and in time O(n                        2log n) and space O(n                        2) in most real-world cases (n and m are respectively the number of vertices and edges in the input graph).},

The rise of the Internet and the wide availability of inexpensive computers have made it possible to gather and analyze network data on a large scale, and the development of a variety of new theoretical tools has allowed us to extract new knowledge from many different kinds of networks. The study of networks is broadly interdisciplinary and important developments have occurred in many fields, including mathematics, physics, computer and information sciences, biology, and the social sciences. This book brings together for the first time the most important breakthroughs in each of these fields and presents them in a coherent fashion, highlighting the strong interconnections between work in different areas. Subjects covered include the measurement and structure of networks in many branches of science, methods for analyzing network data, including methods developed in physics, statistics, and sociology, the fundamentals of graph theory, computer algorithms, and spectral methods, mathematical models of networks, including random graph models and generative models, and theories of dynamical processes taking place on networks"--},

  title = {The Influence of Electoral System on Party Fragmentation in {{Serbian Parliament}}},
  volume = {11},
  abstract = {The subject of this paper is the impact of electoral system and other factors on high fragmentation of the Parliament in Serbia. Party system in Serbia is still not institutionalized, even after 25 years of the introduction of the multiparty system. Two-round majority system was applied in the first multiparty elec-tions, and since 1992 the proportional system with the threshold of 5\% and D'Hondt formula has been in force. Since 2011 Serbia has closed electoral lists and mandates are allocated by the predetermined order. However, after the last elections in 2014 the Parliament in Serbia will have around 20 political parties, unions and other organizations. These stakeholders appear on the electoral lists of the major political parties or in pre-electoral coalitions without graded elec-toral threshold and after entering the parliament form a separate parliamentary group, or distinguish themselves with their own identity, which leads to indirect parliamentarization and fragmentation of the parliament. This reflects on the complexity of the process of (coalition) government formation, but also on the functioning of the parliament. Frequent blackmails from the smaller political parties or changes in the behavior of actors reduce the predictability of actors' actions and slow down the consolidation of democracy in Serbia.},

  abstract = {Abstract Party nationalisation, defined as the homogeneity of party strength across a country, has recently become a major issue in research. Even though territory is a salient political question in the post-communist countries in Europe, party nationalisation in these countries has been neglected by the literature so far. This article presents data on party nationalisation for 20 countries over the period 1990\textendash{}2007. It shows that the nationalisation of party systems in post-communist democracies is closely related to the territorial structure of social divisions, except for cases where the electoral systems provide for a high degree of nationalisation, or where super-presidentialism inhibits the creation of strong nationalised parties.},

It is the first broadly cross-regional analysis of electoral volatility, and it is based on the most extensive data assembled on electoral volatility. Our most original finding is that competitive regimes inaugurated in earlier periods have much lower electoral volatility than regimes inaugurated more recently, even controlling for a variety of other factors that have been hypothesized to affect electoral volatility. Parties had very different functions according to when democracy was inaugurated, and these congenital differences had longterm effects on the stabilization of party competition. What matters for the stabilization of party competition is when democracy was born, not how old it is. Our results support social science approaches that emphasize historical sequences and path dependence.},

  abstract = {This article provides a detailed set of coding rules for disaggregating electoral volatility into two components: volatility caused by new party entry and old party exit, and volatility caused by vote switching across existing parties. After providing an overview of both types of volatility in post-communist countries, the causes of volatility are analysed using a larger dataset than those used in previous studies. The results are startling: most findings based on elections in post-communist countries included in previous studies disappear. Instead, entry and exit volatility is found to be largely a function of long-term economic recovery, and it becomes clear that very little is known about what causes `party switching' volatility. As a robustness test of this latter result, the authors demonstrate that systematic explanations for party-switching volatility in Western Europe can indeed be found. [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]},

It is written in a direct, clear style that is accessible and informative for scientists and science students. It is intended to help science teachers explain how science works, highlighting strengths without ignoring limitations, and to help scientists articulate the process and standards of their work. The book demonstrates that there are several important requirements for being scientific, and the most fundamental of these is maintaining an extensive, interconnected, coherent network of ideas. Some components in the network are empirical, others are theoretical, and they support each other. Clarifying the structure of this web of knowledge explains the role of the commonly cited aspects of scientific method, things like hypotheses, theories, testing, evidence, and the like. A Summary of Scientific Method provides a clear, intuitive, and accurate model of scientific method.},

  volume = {229},
  issn = {0002-9513},
  abstract = {Effects of sodium nitrate were compared with sodium chloride loading on transport of electrolytes by the nephron. Maximal levels of free water clearance/clomerular filtration rate (CH2O/GFR) averaged 8.4\% with nitrate loading and 14.4\% with saline loading. Since ethacrynic acid and chlorothiazide exert their major natriuretic effect in the distal nephron, the increment in Na ad Cl reabsorbed beyond the proximal tubule. The administration of these agents resulted in an increase in fractional sodium excretion (CNa/GFR) of 21.1\%, urinary sodium excretion (UNaV) of 1,126 mueq/min, and urinary chloride excretion (UClV) of 848 mueq/min during nitrate loading compared with an increase in CNa/GFR of 37.6\%, UNaV of 2,362 mueq/min, and UClV of 2,397 mueq/min during saline loading. The smaller diuretic-induced increment in Na and Cl excretion in the nitrate studies suggests, as do the hydrated studies, that less Cl and Na are reabsorbed in the distal nephron during nitrate than saline loading. At every level of UNaV, fractional bicarbonate reabsorption was higher, urine pH was lower, and urinary potassium excretion (UKV) was higher in the nitrate studies. Thus, compared with saline loading, sodium nitrate decreases chloride and sodium reabsorption in the distal nephron. The higher hydrogen and potassium secretion in the nitrate studies may be consequent to the decreased ability of the distal nephron to reabsorb chloride.},

The operations studied were proximal gastric vagotomy (PGV, 20 cases), truncal vagotomy and pyloroplasty (TV+P, 22 cases) and truncal vagotomy and antrectomy (TV+A, 21 cases). Duodenogastric reflux was assessed both by a radiological technique and by measuring the concentration of bilirubin in the gastric aspirate before and after operation. Incidence and severity of postoperative gastritis were determined by endoscopic biopsy. Symptoms were assessed by symptomatic score and Visick grading. There was a significant correlation between duodenal reflux and histological evidence of both severe superficial gastritis and glandular atrophy (P less than 0-01). There was also a close association between the degree of reflux and the presence of severe heartburn, epigastric pain and bile vomiting after operation. The amount of reflux did not differ before operation. There was significantly less reflux following PGV than after either TV+P (P less than 0-025) or TV+A (P less than 0-001). The results indicate that an operation which preserves an innervated and intact antrum and pylorus will protect against postoperative duodenogastric reflux, gastritis and symptoms.},

The network represents the attitude object and cognitions and beliefs related to the attitude, as well as how to integrate a persuasive message into this network. Short-term effects are modeled by activation patterns due to parallel constraint satisfaction processes, and long-term effects are modeled by weight changes due to the settling patterns of activation. Phenomena modeled include thought-induced attitude polarization, elaboration and attitude strength, motivated reasoning and social influence, an integrated view of heuristic versus systematic persuasion, and implicit versus explicit attitude change. Results of the simulations are consistent with empirical results. The same set of simple mechanisms is used to model all the phenomena, which allows the model to offer a parsimonious theoretical account of how structure can impact attitude change. This model is compared with previous computational approaches to attitudes, and implications for attitude research are discussed.},

These data are collected by the administration of a questionnaire made of items concerning different aspects related to the immigration phenomenon. For this analysis we rely on a class of item response theory models that allow for: (i) multidimensionality; (ii) discreteness of the latent trait distribution; (iii) time-constant and time-varying covariates; and (iv) sample weights. Through these models we find latent classes of Europeans with similar levels of immigration acceptance, we study the effect of different socio-economic covariates on the probability of belonging to these classes, and we assess the item characteristics. In this way we show which countries tend to be more or less positive towards immigration and the temporal dynamics of the phenomenon under study.},

Here, we test the central postulate of the CAN model that highly connected attitude networks correspond to strong attitudes. We use data from the American National Election Studies 1980-2012 on attitudes toward presidential candidates (total n = 18,795).

Second, we show that connectivity is strongly related to two defining features of strong attitudes - stability of the attitude and the attitude's impact on behavior.

We performed two types of measurement equivalence tests: exact and approximate. Whereas the exact approach requires that measurement parameters are exactly equal across groups, the approximate and newer approach suggests that it is sufficient that measurement parameters are approximately equal to allow a meaningful comparison across groups. Our findings suggest that two measurement scales, allowing immigrants into the country and realistic threat, are approximately invariant across most ESS countries.},

Using the special module of the sixth round of the European Social Survey `Europeans' understandings and evaluations of democracy' and applying Bayesian factor analysis with country random effects, this article tests whether multiple indicators form an underlying trait measuring citizens' evaluations of democracy. It finds the scores of this measure at the individual and country levels and validates this measure against other measures built at the system level, including the `satisfaction with democracy' indicator, also illustrating its functioning as a dependent and an independent variable.},

The goal of the present study is to test whether and to what extent questions in the module are equivalent across ESS countries. We performed two types of measurement equivalence tests: exact and approximate. Whereas the exact approach requires that measurement parameters are exactly equal across groups, the approximate and newer approach suggests that it is sufficient that measurement parameters are approximately equal to allow a meaningful comparison across groups. Our findings suggest that two measurement scales, allowing immigrants into the country and realistic threat, are approximately invariant across most ESS countries.},

  abstract = {Structural equation modeling (SEM) is evolving as available data is becoming more complex, reaching the limits of what traditional estimation approaches can achieve. As SEM expands to ever larger, more complex applications, the estimation challenge grows and currently available methods will be insufficient. To overcome this challenge in SEM, we see an opportunity to use existing solutions from the field of deep learning, which has been pioneering methods for estimation of complex models for decades. To this end, this paper introduces computation graphs, a flexible method of specifying objective functions. When combined with state-of-the-art optimizers, we argue that our computation graph approach is capable not only of estimating SEM models, but also of rapidly extending them -- without the need of bespoke software development for each new extension. We show that several SEM improvements follow naturally from our approach; not only existing extensions such as least absolute deviation estimation and penalized regression models, but also novel extensions such as spike-and-slab penalties for sparse factor analysis. By applying computation graphs to SEM, we hope to greatly accelerate the process of developing SEM techniques, paving the way for novel applications. The accompanying R package tensorsem is under active development.},

  shorttitle = {Homophily as a Process Generating Social Networks},
  abstract = {Real-world social networks often exhibit high levels of clustering, positive degree assortativity, short average path lengths (small-world property) and bounded, which means not scale-free, degree distributions. At the same time homophily, defined as the propensity of similar agents to connect to each other, is one of the characteristic features observed in many human and animal societies. In this paper we examine an extent to which homophily may be considered an important force generating and structuring social networks. To do so, we conduct a simulation study based on Social Distance Attachment (SDA) network model in which nodes are embedded in an abstract social space and connection probabilities depend functionally on distances between nodes. We find that homophily, especially when combined with random edge rewiring, can reproduce many of the characteristic features of social networks. Additionally, we devise a hybrid model combining SDA with configuration model that allows to generate homophily-driven networks with arbitrary degree distributions and we use it to study interactions of homophily with processes imposing constraints on degree distributions. We show that the effects of homophily on clustering are robust with respect to distribution constraints, while degree assortativity can be highly dependent on the particular kind of enforced degree sequence. Numerical results are additionally enriched with a review of theoretical and/or analytical arguments supporting both the general geometric approach to social networks and homophily as well as the particular functional form of the connection probability function assumed in SDA model.},

  abstract = {The paper considers compulsory voting as a means of increasing voter turnout. The behavior of citizens with an active electoral right, but not participating in the voting (non-voters) can be compared with the behavior of a stowaway in public transport: even if he does not pay the fare, there will still be transport, because there are those who pay the fare. The non-voter does not participate in the creation, he only consumes. It is obvious that if nobody takes part in the elections, the foundations of democracy will collapse. Obliging to participate in elections can have both positive and negative effects on the development of civil society, raising the level of electoral and legal culture of the population, and developing state institutions. It is possible that the imposition of sanctions on mandatory elections may also reduce recognition of democracy. Ideas related to the possibility of deprivation of citizenship of those not participating in elections are critically evaluated. It is emphasized that there is insufficient evidence to judge the relationship between voter turnout and voting results. It is proposed to clearly affirm the obligation of state and municipal employees to participate in elections. If the level of citizenship and electoral culture of voters becomes higher, the issue of compulsory vote will lose its relevance. Voluntary voting is usually better than compulsory.},

Overall, we find little empirical support for the claim. This is caused by significant reliability and validity problems related to measuring threat-sensitivity using electrodermal activity. When assesed reliably, electrodermal activity in the replications and published studies captures individual differences in the physiological changes associated with attention shifts, which are unrelated to ideology. In contrast to psychophysiological reactions, self-reported emotional reactions to threatening stimuli are reliably associated with ideology.},

Yet the inherent complexity of such theories makes them difficult to test. These theories often describe multiple sub-processes that interact reciprocally over time, at different levels of analysis, and over different time scales. Computational (i.e., mathematical) modeling is increasingly advocated as a method for developing and testing theories of this type. In organizational sciences however, efforts that have been made to test models empirically are often indirect. We argue that the full potential of computational modeling as a tool for testing dynamic, multilevel theory is yet to be realized. In this paper, we demonstrate an approach to testing dynamic, multilevel theory using computational modeling. The approach uses simulations to generate model predictions, and Bayesian parameter estimation to fit models to empirical data and to facilitate model comparisons. This approach enables a direct integration between theory, model, and data, that we believe enables a more rigorous test of theory.},

Second, the history of attitude-behavior correspondence can be organized also around three broad themes: an early period in which the presumed close association between attitudes and behaviors was largely an article of faith; a middle period in which some researchers concluded that little, if any, relationship existed between measures of attitudes and overt behaviors; and a more recent period in which the resolution of prior issues stimulated an explosion of research focused on identifying the moderators and psychological mechanisms responsible for attitude-behavior correspondence. Finally, the history of research and ideas regarding attitude change and persuasion can be organized around several prominent theories focused on distinct single processes, dual processes, or multiple processes, each of which are still used by contemporary attitudes researchers.},

This is true, for example, in trial data drawn from vulnerable communities where social ties are difficult to query directly. In this paper we combine techniques from the structure learning and interference literatures in causal inference, proposing a general method for estimating causal effects under data dependence when the structure of this dependence is not known a priori.

Dozens of review works attempt to order such a diverse landscape -- classifying community discovery algorithms by the process they employ to detect communities, by their explicitly stated definition of community, or by their performance on a standardized task. In this paper, we classify community discovery algorithms according to a fourth criterion: the similarity of their results. We create an Algorithm Similarity Network (ASN), whose nodes are the community detection approaches, connected if they return similar groupings. We then perform community detection on this network, grouping algorithms that consistently return the same partitions or overlapping coverage over a span of more than one thousand synthetic and real world networks. This paper is an attempt to create a similarity-based classification of community detection algorithms based on empirical data. It improves over the state of the art by comparing more than seventy approaches, discovering that the ASN contains well-separated groups, making it a sensible tool for practitioners, aiding their choice of algorithms fitting their analytic needs.},

To date, most research has been conducted on the United States, and what little comparative research exists has typically covered a small number of countries. In this paper we present the largest comparative study yet conducted on turnout misreporting. By utilising 20 years of data from Comparative Study of Electoral Systems (CSES) we analyse 184 elections across 55 different states. In addition to testing the social desirability and mode effects explanations for misreporting, we examine the electoral and party systems and survey methodology. The results show that the operation of the electoral system and the survey methodology are the most important explanations for misreporting, but there are also significant effects for the election context and the party system. These results provide an important corrective to current studies by showing that institutional factors are at least as important in shaping misreporting as methodology.},

Despite rapid progress in the field, questions of adequate measurement and empirical evaluation of measures of populist attitudes remain scarce. Seeking to remedy these shortcomings, we apply a cross-national measurement model, using item response theory, to six established and two new populist indicators. Drawing on a cross-national survey (nine European countries, n\,=\,18,368), we engage in a four-folded analysis. First, we examine the commonly used 6-item populism scale. Second, we expand the measurement with two novel items. Third, we use the improved 8-item populism scale to further refine equally comprehensive but more concise and parsimonious populist measurements. Finally, we externally validate these sub-scales and find that some of the proposed sub-scales outperform the initial 6- and 8-item scales. We conclude that existing measures of populism capture moderate populist attitudes, but face difficulties measuring more extreme levels, while the individual information of some of the populist items remains limited. Altogether, this provides several interesting routes for future research, both within and between countries.},

A perfectly nationalized party system is a party system with only national parties or, in other words, without sub-national parties. Instead of the homogeneity of parties' vote shares or the number of parties throughout the country, our measure captures the aspirations of parties to be national whose proxy is the proportion of districts (weighted by seats) that a party runs a candidate. The measure is compared with existing indicators through a longitudinal analysis of 256 elections in 18 Western European countries from 1945 to 1998.},

This combination of cognitive and social processes has outcomes that are qualitatively different from either only cognitive or only social processes, which shows the importance of studying these together. An illustration that moves towards representing the processes involved in Brexit is also exhibited to show the potential of this kind of simulation. Whilst only conceived of as an illustration of a kind of model, it is consistent with a number of observed patterns in opinion poll data, with some social and cognitive theories and only consists of plausible processes. This kind of model could also be used to relate and integrate different kinds of evidence into a coherent framework in the shape of more developed simulations.},

  title = {Exploring the Solution Landscape Enables More Reliable Network Community Detection},
  abstract = {To understand how a complex system is organized and functions, researchers often identify communities in the system's network of interactions. Because it is practically impossible to explore all solutions to guarantee the best one, many community-detection algorithms rely on multiple stochastic searches. But for a given combination of network and stochastic algorithm, how many searches are sufficient to find a solution that is good enough? The standard approach is to pick a reasonably large number of searches and select the network partition with the highest quality or derive a consensus solution based on all network partitions. However, if different partitions have similar qualities such that the solution landscape is degenerate, the single best partition may miss relevant information, and a consensus solution may blur complementary communities. Here we address this degeneracy problem with coarse-grained descriptions of the solution landscape. We cluster network partitions based on their similarity and suggest an approach to determine the minimum number of searches required to describe the solution landscape adequately. To make good use of all partitions, we also propose different ways to explore the solution landscape, including a significance clustering procedure. We test these approaches on synthetic and real-world networks, and find that different networks and algorithms require a different number of searches and that exploring the coarse-grained solution landscape can reveal noteworthy complementary solutions and enable more reliable community detection.},

  title = {Using Synthetic Networks for Parameter Tuning in Community Detection},
  abstract = {Community detection is one of the most important and challenging problems in network analysis. However, real-world networks may have very different structural properties and communities of various nature. As a result, it is hard (or even impossible) to develop one algorithm suitable for all datasets. A standard machine learning tool is to consider a parametric algorithm and choose its parameters based on the dataset at hand. However, this approach is not applicable to community detection since usually no labeled data is available for such parameter tuning. In this paper, we propose a simple and effective procedure allowing to tune hyperparameters of any given community detection algorithm without requiring any labeled data. The core idea is to generate a synthetic network with properties similar to a given real-world one, but with known communities. It turns out that tuning parameters on such synthetic graph also improves the quality for a given real-world network. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, we show significant improvements obtained for several well-known parametric community detection algorithms on a variety of synthetic and real-world datasets.},

We propose here a measure of similarities between vertices based on random walks which has several important advantages: it captures well the community structure in a network, it can be computed efficiently, and it can be used in an agglomerative algorithm to compute efficiently the community structure of a network. We propose such an algorithm, called Walktrap, which runs in time O(mn\^2) and space O(n\^2) in the worst case, and in time O(n\^2log n) and space O(n\^2) in most real-world cases (n and m are respectively the number of vertices and edges in the input graph). Extensive comparison tests show that our algorithm surpasses previously proposed ones concerning the quality of the obtained community structures and that it stands among the best ones concerning the running time.},

  abstract = {Estimating conditional dependence graphs and precision matrices are some of the most common problems in modern statistics and machine learning. When data are fully observed, penalized maximum likelihood-type estimators have become standard tools for estimating graphical models under sparsity conditions. Extensions of these methods to more complex settings where data are contaminated with additive or multiplicative noise have been developed in recent years. In these settings, however, the relative performance of different methods is not well understood and algorithmic gaps still exist. In particular, in high-dimensional settings these methods require using non-positive semidefinite matrices as inputs, presenting novel optimization challenges. We develop an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm for these problems, providing a feasible algorithm to estimate precision matrices with indefinite input and potentially nonconvex penalties. We compare this method with existing alternative solutions and empirically characterize the tradeoffs between them. Finally, we use this method to explore the networks among US senators estimated from voting records data.},

  abstract = {Dimension reduction is one of the oldest concerns in geographical analysis. Despite significant, longstanding attention in geographical problems, recent advances in non-linear techniques for dimension reduction, called manifold learning, have not been adopted in classic data-intensive geographical problems. More generally, machine learning methods for geographical problems often focus more on applying standard machine learning algorithms to geographic data, rather than applying true "spatially-correlated learning," in the words of Kohonen. As such, we suggest a general way to incentivize geographical learning in machine learning algorithms, and link it to many past methods that introduced geography into statistical techniques. We develop a specific instance of this by specifying two geographical variants of Isomap, a non-linear dimension reduction, or "manifold learning," technique. We also provide a method for assessing what is added by incorporating geography and estimate the manifold's intrinsic geographic scale. To illustrate the concepts and provide interpretable results, we conducting a dimension reduction on geographical and high-dimensional structure of social and economic data on Brooklyn, New York. Overall, this paper's main endeavor--defining and explaining a way to "geographize" many machine learning methods--yields interesting and novel results for manifold learning the estimation of intrinsic geographical scale in unsupervised learning.},

If it takes a book to get it across, I hope this book will do it. It ought to."--Thomas Schelling, Distinguished University Professor, School of Public Policy, University of Maryland, and 2005 Nobel Prize Laureate in Economics "With humor, insight, piercing logic and a nod to history, Ziliak and McCloskey show how economists-and other scientists-suffer from a mass delusion about statistical analysis. The quest for statistical significance that pervades science today is a deeply flawed substitute for thoughtful analysis. ... Yet few participants in the scientific bureaucracy have been willing to admit what Ziliak and McCloskey make clear: the emperor has no clothes."--Kenneth Rothman, Professor of Epidemiology, Boston University School of Health The Cult of Statistical Significance shows, field by field, how "statistical significance," a technique that dominates many sciences, has been a huge mistake. The authors find that researchers in a broad spectrum of fields, from agronomy to zoology, employ "testing" that doesn't test and "estimating" that doesn't estimate. The facts will startle the outside reader: how could a group of brilliant scientists wander so far from scientific magnitudes? This study will encourage scientists who want to know how to get the statistical sciences back on track and fulfill their quantitative promise. The book shows for the first time how wide the disaster is, and how bad for science, and it traces the problem to its historical, sociological, and philosophical roots. Stephen T.

In this framework, psychological variables are understood to directly affect each other rather than being caused by an unobserved latent entity. In this tutorial, we introduce the reader to estimating the most popular network model for psychological data: the partial correlation network. We describe how regularization techniques can be used to efficiently estimate a parsimonious and interpretable network structure in psychological data. We show how to perform these analyses in R and demonstrate the method in an empirical example on posttraumatic stress disorder data. In addition, we discuss the effect of the hyperparameter that needs to be manually set by the researcher, how to handle non-normal data, how to determine the required sample size for a network analysis, and provide a checklist with potential solutions for problems that can arise when estimating regularized partial correlation networks.

Psychopathology networks consist of aspects (e.g., symptoms) of mental disorders (nodes) and the connections between those aspects (edges). Unfortunately, the visual presentation of networks can occasionally be misleading. For instance, researchers may be tempted to conclude that nodes that appear close together are highly related, and that nodes that are far apart are less related. Yet this is not always the case. In networks plotted with force-directed algorithms, the most popular approach, the spatial arrangement of nodes is not easily interpretable. However, other plotting approaches can render node positioning interpretable. We provide a brief tutorial on several methods including multidimensional scaling, principal components plotting, and eigenmodel networks. We compare the strengths and weaknesses of each method, noting how to properly interpret each type of plotting approach.},

  abstract = {Previous research and methodological advice has focused on the importance of accounting for measurement error in psychological data. That perspective assumes that psychological variables conform to a common factor model, such that they consist of construct variance plus error. In this paper, we explore what happens when a set of items that are not generated from a common factor construct model are nonetheless modeled as reflecting a common factor. Through a series of hypothetical examples and an empirical re-analysis, we show that (1) common factor models tend to produce extremely biased and highly variable structural parameter estimates when the population model is not a common factor model; (2) model fit is a poor indicator of the degree of bias; and (3) composite models are sometimes more reliable than common factor models under alternative measurement structures, though they also lead to unacceptably bad solutions in some cases.},

  abstract = {The maximization of generalized modularity performs well on networks in which the members of all communities are statistically indistinguishable from each other. However, there is no theory defining the maximization performance in more realistic networks where edges are heterogeneously distributed within and between communities. We establish the asymptotic theoretical bounds on the resolution parameter of generalized modularity using the random graph properties. From this new perspective on random graph model, we find the resolution limit of modularity maximization can be explained in a surprisingly simple and straightforward way. Given a network produced by the stochastic block models, the communities for which the resolution parameter is larger than their densities are likely to be spread among multiple clusters; while communities for which the resolution parameter is smaller than their background inter-community edge density get merged into one large component. Therefore, no suitable resolution parameter exits when the intra-community edge density in a subgraph is lower than the inter-community edge density in some other subgraph. For such networks, we propose a progressive agglomerative heuristic algorithm to detect statistically significant communities at multiple scales.},

  abstract = {Exploratory graph analysis (EGA) is a recent addition to the growing field of network psychometrics. EGA has emerged as a popular approach for estimating the dimensonality of data in networks. The appeal of EGA is the visualization of the relations between variables and the deterministic allocation of variables into dimensions. Notably, networks tend to be sample-specific, making reproducibility and generalizability a key issue in network psychometrics. To resolve this issue, we've developed a novel bootstrap approach called, Bootstrap Exploratory Graph Analysis (bootEGA). bootEGA provides researchers with dimension and item stability statistics as well as item analyses that are akin to exploratory factor analysis loadings. We provide descriptions of bootEGA's functions accompanied by a step-by-step R tutorial for how to apply and interpret bootEGA's results. This tutorial is applied to real-world data to demonstrate its effectiveness at identifying problematic dimensions and items. In short, our results show that bootEGA is a robust approach for identifying the stability and robustness of dimensionality in data.},

At the same time, the molecule is converted to a form of limited solubility, which is precipitated at low pH, where activation is normally seen. The results are interpreted in terms of the peculiar structure of the pepsinogen molecule. Titration of the basic NH2-terminal region produced an open form, which can return to the native form at neutral pH, but which is maintained at low pH by neutralization of carboxylate groups in the pepsin portion.},

  abstract = {The effects of pH variation on ionic exchange and mechanical function were studied in the arterially perfused rat and rabbit septa. The pH and PCO2 of the control perfusate were 7.40 and 39 mmHg, respectively. In the rabbit septum a metabolic acidosis (pH equals 6.82, PCO2 equals 39 mmHg) caused a loss of 16\% of control tension in 12 min. Na+ and K+ exchange were unaltered. A comparable respiratory acidosis (pH equals 6.81, PCO2 equals 159 mmHg) caused a 51\% loss of tension in 2 min. Na+ exchange was unaltered but K+ efflux fell from 8.9 +/- 0.6 (mean +/- SE) to 4.9 +/- 0.3 mmol/kg dry wt per min (P less than 0.001, n equals 10). A net gain of K+ of 16.9 +/- 1.7 (n equals 14) mmol/kg dry wt occurred and was attributable to a delayed fall in K+ influx relative to efflux over 15 min. The net gain could not be mimicked by epinephrine administration or blocked by propranolol and was absent in the beating rat septum and the quiescent rabbit septum. These results suggest that the net uptake of K+, which appears to be dependent on a period of depolarization, and the changes of contractility are controlled by the H+ ion concentration at a cellular site whose exchange with the extracellular space is characterized by a considerable restriction of diffusion. Changes of contractility are not related to the net uptake of K+.},

Results of LASSO network analysis showed that exhibitionism (NPI) is the most central node, followed by the contingent self-esteem (PNI) and need for admiration (FFNI). Community network analysis showed that four communities could be detected: 1. exhibitionism, which also includes vanity and grandiose fantasies, 2. exploitativeness/entitlement, which also captures callousness, 3. authority/manipulativeness, and 4. vulnerable narcissism. The results revealed the complexity of grandiose narcissism, compared to vulnerable narcissism in applied set of instruments.},
