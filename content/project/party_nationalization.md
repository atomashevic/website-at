This project encompasses research related to my [PhD thesis](https://www.atomasevic.com/publication/tomasevic-spatial-network-decomposition-2018/). The central theme of the project is fill in the gap in the literature connecting electoral volatility (general measure of party system change) with studies of party nationalization (spatial homogenization of electoral behavior) using spatial statistics, network analysis and graphical modeling.

The main outcome of the thesis is a new methdology for studying party nationalizaton using electoral volatility as a baseline measure. New party nationalization measure called "volatility localization index" is formulated and applied in main empirical part of the thesis.
